 All graph state verification protocols are composably secure Léo Colisson (CWI/QuSoft, Amsterdam); Damian Markham (CNRS); Raja Yehia (ICFO)  [abstract] Abstract: Graph state verification protocols allow multiple parties to share a graph state while checking that the state is honestly prepared, even in the presence of malicious parties. Since graph states are the starting point of numerous quantum protocols, it is crucial to ensure that graph state verification protocols can safely be composed with other protocols, this property being known as composable security."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="/accepted-papers/"><meta property="og:image" content="/images/social-share.jpg"><meta property="article:section" content><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-09-01T16:56:15+02:00"><meta property="og:site_name" content="QCrypt 2024"><meta itemprop=name content="Accepted Papers"><meta itemprop=description content="List of Accepted Contributed Talks (in order of submission)

Since graph states are the starting point of numerous quantum protocols, it is crucial to ensure that graph state verification protocols can safely be composed with other protocols, this property being known as composable security. Previous works conjectured that such a property could not be proven within the abstract cryptography framework: we disprove this conjecture by showing that all graph state verification protocols can be turned into a composably secure protocol with respect to the natural functionality for graph state preparation. Moreover, we show that any unchanged graph state verification protocol can also be considered as composably secure for a slightly different, yet useful, functionality. Finally, we show that these two results are optimal, in the sense that any such generic result, considering arbitrary black-box protocols, must either modify the protocol or consider a different functionality. Along the way, we show a protocol to generalize entanglement swapping to arbitrary graph states that might be of independent interest.</div></div></div></li><li value=18><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>A fast and robust quantum random number generator with a self-contained integrated photonic randomness core</div><div class=paper-authors>Davide G.

Consequently, the need for secure and high-rate random number generation has become increasingly urgent. While integrated photonics technology holds promise for mass-producing optoelectronic quantum random number generators (QRNGs), there remains a challenge in developing fast, robust, and scalable solutions suitable for industrial deployment. Addressing this challenge, we present a fast QRNG solution in this study, leveraging a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) directly embedded onto a versatile electronic platform. Designed to withstand real-world applications, our PIC is packaged to align with industrial electronic assembly lines. To rigorously assess scalability and stability, these generators underwent week-long periods of continuous GHz operation. Furthermore, a QRNG was integrated into a quantum key distribution system, where despite operating in an uncontrolled environment, minimal variations in physical randomness were observed over 38 days, as measured from 2.9 million histograms. Finally, we implemented a security model for the QRNGs, enabling rate adjustment to match the actual randomness content and demonstrating secure generation at 2 Gbit/s.</div></div></div></li><li value=20><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Conditional disclosure of secrets with quantum resources</div><div class=paper-authors>Alex May (Institute for Quantum Computing and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo);

CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. Following the classical literature on CDS for guidance, we establish closure under negation, an amplification property, and prove a number of lower bounds on CDQS based on communication complexity.</div></div></div>merged with #96:<div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Lower bounds on entanglement and quantum gates in non-local quantum computation</div><div class=paper-authors>Alex May (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics);

We study two classes of NLQC, f-routing and f-BB84. These are well studied in the context of position-verification, where they are leading candidates for feasible and secure verification schemes. Both settings require an honest prover implement only O(1) quantum operations. We prove that a dishonest prover must use linear quantum resources to attack the same scheme. First, we give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Our bound can be stated in terms of the quantum non-deterministic communication complexity of f. For the equality, non-equality, and greater-than functions we obtain linear lower bounds on entanglement for f-routing and f-BB84 in the perfect setting. In a second result, which applies in the robust setting, we give a new lower bound on the number of quantum gates and measurements needed to attack these verification schemes. We lower bound the gates plus measurements linearly in the simultaneous message passing cost of the function f. This leads to a linear bound against the inner product function. This gives a clear separation between the difficulty of implementing these tasks in the honest and dishonest settings, and does so in a noise robust and loss tolerant setting.</div></div></div></li><li value=23><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Making Existing Quantum Position Verification Protocols Secure Against Arbitrary Transmission Loss</div><div class=paper-authors>Rene Allerstorfer (QuSoft (CWI Amsterdam));

In quantum position verification (QPV) protocols, even relatively small loss rates can compromise security. The goal is thus to find protocols that remain secure under practically achievable loss rates. In this work, we modify the usual structure of QPV protocols and prove that this modification makes the potentially high transmission loss between the verifiers and the prover security-irrelevant for a class of protocols that includes a practically-interesting candidate protocol inspired by the BB84 protocol. This modification, which involves photon presence detection, a small time delay at the prover, and a commitment to play before proceeding, reduces the overall loss rate to just the prover’s laboratory. The adapted protocol then becomes a practically feasible QPV protocol with strong security guarantees, even against attackers using adaptive strategies. As the loss rate between the verifiers and prover is mainly dictated by the distance between them, secure QPV over longer distances becomes possible. We also show possible implementations of the required photon presence detection, making the adapted protocol a protocol that solves all major practical issues in QPV. Finally, we discuss experimental aspects and give parameter estimations.</div></div></div></li><li value=24><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>On the composable security of weak coin flipping</div><div class=paper-authors>Jiawei Wu (National University of Singapore);

In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Through this study, we disclose security vulnerabilities associated with TF-class QKD implementation and provide valuable insights into its practical security.</div></div></div></li><li value=37><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Security Proof for Variable-Length Quantum Key Distribution</div><div class=paper-authors>Devashish Tupkary (Institute for Quantum Computing);

Our second main result is the description and security proof of a more general class of variable-length QKD protocols, which does not require characterizing the honest behaviour of the channel connecting the users before the execution of the QKD protocol. Instead, these protocols adaptively determine the length of the final key, and the amount of information to be used for error-correction, based upon the observations made during the protocol. We apply these results to the qubit BB84 protocol, and show that variable-length implementations lead to higher expected key rates than the fixed-length implementations. Finally, we point out a critical flaw in the analysis of privacy amplification that arises due to sifting. We provide an elegant solution that retroactively fixes this flaw.</div></div></div>merged with #38:<div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Variable-length QKD security proof for imperfect detectors through phase-error estimation</div><div class=paper-authors>Devashish Tupkary (Institute for Quantum Computing);

However, the loss tolerance of SPS-based QKD is compromised by photon number splitting (PNS) attacks against non-negligible multiphoton emissions. Decoy state (DS) techniques mitigate against PNS attacks, with WCP-DS QKD over several hundred km in fibre being demonstrated. DS QKD protocols for different source photon number statistics have been proposed, such as for binomial and thermal distributions. Here, we investigate the use of generalised DS techniques assuming we do not have access to the true photon number statistics of the SPS. Thus, we bound the source distribution using the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function, which provides us with enough partial knowledge to compute our decoy SPS protocols. Hence, we provide finite-key security bounds for an SPS-based Efficient BB84 for several decoy protocols with optimised parameters, and derive required SPS characteristics to achieve a key rate enhancement over DS WCPs and match their loss tolerance.</div></div></div></li><li value=47><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Implementation of mode-pairing quantum key distribution in inter-city networks</div><div class=paper-authors>Yizhi Huang (Center for Quantum Information, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University);

Most common protocols are grouped into two distinct categories based on the degrees of freedom used to carry information, which can be either discrete or continuous, each presenting unique advantages in either performance, feasibility for near-term implementation, and compatibility with existing telecommunications architectures. Recently, hybrid QKD protocols have been introduced to leverage advantages from both categories. In this work we provide a rigorous security proof for a protocol introduced by Qi in 2021, where information is encoded in discrete variables as in the widespread Bennett Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol but decoded continuously via heterodyne detection. Security proofs for hybrid protocols inherit the same challenges associated with continuous-variable protocols due to unbounded dimensions. Here we successfully address these challenges by exploiting symmetry. Our approach enables truncation of the Hilbert space with precise control of the approximation errors and lead to a tight, semi-analytical expression for the asymptotic key rate under collective attacks. As concrete examples, we apply our theory to compute the key rates under passive attacks, linear loss, and Gaussian noise.</div></div></div></li><li value=56><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>High-speed Heterodyne-based Quantum Random Number Generator on a Chip</div><div class=paper-authors>Tommaso Bertapelle (Università degli Studi di Padova);

Eurocrypt' 23, Ananth et. al. TCC' 23), as a strengthened security notion to its predecessor put forward in Ananth et. al. (Eurocrypt' 21). This problem aims to leverage unclonable nature of quantum information to allow a lessor to lease a quantum key with reusability for evaluating a classical functionality. Later, the lessor can request the lessee to provably delete the key and then the lessee will be completely deprived of the capability to evaluate. In this work, we construct a secure key leasing scheme to lease a decryption key of a (classical) public-key, homomorphic encryption scheme from standard lattice assumptions. Our encryption scheme is exactly identical to the (primal) version of Gentry-Sahai-Waters homomorphic encryption scheme with a carefully chosen public key matrix. We achieve strong form of security where: The entire protocol (including key generation and verification of deletion) uses merely classical communication between a classical lessor (client) and a quantum lessee (server). Assuming standard assumptions, our security definition ensures that every computationally bounded quantum adversary could only simultaneously provide a valid classical deletion certificate and yet distinguish ciphertexts with at most some negligible probability. Our security relies on subexponential time hardness of learning with errors assumption. Our scheme is the first scheme to be based on a standard assumption and satisfying the two properties mentioned above. The main technical novelty in our work is the design of an FHE scheme that enables us to apply elegant analyses done in the context of classical verification of quantumness from LWE (Brakerski et. al.(FOCS'18, JACM'21) and its parallel amplified version in Radian et. al.(AFT'21)) to the setting of secure leasing. This connection to classical verification of quantumness leads to a modular construction and arguably simpler proofs than previously known. An important technical component we prove along the way is an amplified quantum search-to-decision reduction: we design an extractor that uses a quantum distinguisher (who has an internal quantum state) for decisional LWE, to extract secrets with success probability amplified to almost one. This technique might be of independent interest.</div></div></div></li><li value=91><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution Across National Scale Telecommunication Infrastructure</div><div class=paper-authors>Mirko Pittaluga (Toshiba Europe Ltd);

Coherent quantum communications refer to QC schemes relying on maintaining optical coherence between nodes for successful execution. These schemes typically involve single photon interference between optical fields generated by distant parties and represent a cornerstone of a promising architecture of the quantum internet. Despite their significant potential, scientific and technical hurdles - including optical coherence maintenance, integrating high-performance single-photon detectors, and precise stabilisation and synchronisation - have prevented the implementation of coherent QC over existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here we present the first realisation of a coherent QC fully integrated into standard telecommunication infrastructure over a link connecting the German cities of Frankfurt and Kehl. The implemented scheme is the Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, enabling the distribution of a shared secret key for encryption at a rate of 110 bit/s over a highly asymmetric 254 km link. This result, obtained with a system featuring measurement-device-independent properties, marks the longest installed QKD implementation utilising non-cryogenic cooled detectors and was enabled by the QC system architecture we developed and by our approach to phase stabilisation, which involves active out-of-band phase stabilisation and avalanche photodiodes for single photon detection. This achievement, not only represents a milestone for practical quantum communications but also validates the compatibility of coherent QC with current telecommunication infrastructure, supporting the feasibility of a phase-based architecture for the quantum internet.</div></div></div></li><li value=101><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>The Quantum Decoherence Model: Everlasting Commitments and Quantum Incompressible Encryption</div><div class=paper-authors>Anne Müller (CISPA - Helmholtz Center for Information Security);

In a nutshell, this model requires that the adversary is computationally bounded during the run of a protocol (and some time after), but becomes computationally unbounded long after the protocol terminates. Importantly, once the adversary becomes computationally unbounded, he can only remember a bounded number of qubits from before the bound was lifted. As our main contribution, we construct a non-interactive commitment scheme achieving unconditional security against malicious senders and everlasting security against malicious receivers in the UC model.

In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a digest by once again iterating the block function on the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction in the case when the block function is modeled as a random function or one-way permutation, the case of permutations allowing inverse queries, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem. In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the “double-sided zero-search” conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint’ 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random 2n-bit permutation requires at least Ω(2^n/2) many queries—and this is tight due to Grover’s algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel “symmetrization argument” which uses insights from the theory of Young subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations in the quantum random permutation model.</div></div></div></li><li value=110><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Mutual information chain rules for security proofs robust against device imperfections</div><div class=paper-authors>Amir Arqand (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo);

First, we derive a chain rule between smooth min-entropy and smooth max-information, which improves over previous chain rules for characterizing one-shot information leakage caused by an additional conditioning register. Second, we derive an information accumulation theorem that bounds the Rényi mutual information of a state produced by a sequence of channels, in terms of the Rényi mutual information of the individual channel outputs. In particular, this yields simple bounds on the smooth max-information in the preceding chain rule. Third, we derive chain rules between Rényi entropies and Rényi mutual information, which can be used to modify the entropy accumulation theorem to accommodate leakage registers sent to the adversary in each round of a protocol. We show that these results can be used to handle some device imperfections in a variety of device-dependent and device-independent protocols, such as randomness generation and quantum key distribution.</div></div></div></li><li value=111><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Experimental Sample-Efficient Device-Independent Verification and Certification of a 4-qubit GHZ state</div><div class=paper-authors>Laura dos Santos Martins (LIP6 - Sorbonne Université);

In particular, the verification of quantum states is often used as a building block for communication tasks, determining whether the communicating parties can trust the resources at hand to exchange information or whether the protocol should be aborted. Self-testing methods have been used to tackle such verification tasks in a device-independent (DI) scenario. However, these approaches commonly consider the limit of large, identically and independently distributed (IID) samples, which weakens the DI claim and poses serious challenges to their experimental implementation. To address these issues, Gocanin et al. [1] developed a protocol to certify quantum states in the few-copies and non-IID regime. In this work, we adopt their protocol to experimentally demonstrate the device-independent verification of a four-photon GHZ state, produced with our compact and high-fidelity multipartite entangled photon source.</div></div></div></li><li value=117><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Unconditionally Secure Commitments with Quantum Auxiliary Inputs</div><div class=paper-authors>Tomoyuki Morimae (Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan);

We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption, $QIP not subseteq QMA$. On the other hand, we observe that achieving both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest. 2. We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state (CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain model. We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfers, and multi-party computations.</div></div></div></li><li value=121><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Commitments are equivalent to one-way state generators</div><div class=paper-authors>Rishabh Batra (CQT, NUS);

First, we improve the postselection technique - both by improving the cost paid for the uplift, and by rigorously showing how it can be applied to generic optical protocols. Second, we fundamentally improve the decoy-state analysis in such a way that we require only one decoy intensity to achieve the same performance as prior analysis with two decoy intensities. This has two consequences - it makes the protocol easier to practically implement, and reduces the penalty incurred by using the postselection technique. Third, we extend the finite-size QKD analysis to decoy-state protocols and generically improve the finite-size correction terms that appear.

However, their construction relied on post-quantumly secure indistinguishability obfuscation, a very strong primitive which is not known from standard cryptographic assumptions. In contrast, the primitives we use (namely, collapsing hash functions and a mild version of quantum homomorphic encryption) are much weaker and are implied by standard assumptions such as LWE.

This has motivated a long line of research into random unitaries that ``look'' sufficiently Haar random while also being efficient to implement. Two different notions of derandomisation have emerged: t-designs are random unitaries that information-theoretically reproduce the first t moments of the Haar measure, and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) are random unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar random.In this work, we take a unified approach to constructing t-designs and PRUs. For this, we introduce and analyse the ``PFC ensemble'', the product of a computational basis permutation P, a random binary phase operator F, and a random Clifford unitary C. We show that this ensemble reproduces exponentially high moments of the Haar measure. We can then derandomise the PFC ensemble to show the following:-Linear-depth t-designs. We give the first construction of a (diamond-error) approximate t-design with circuit depth linear in t. This follows from the PFC ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their 2t-wise independent counterparts. - Non-adaptive PRUs. We give the first construction of PRUs with non-adaptive security, i.e. we construct unitaries that are indistinguishable from Haar random to polynomial-time distinguishers that query the unitary in parallel on an arbitary state. This follows from the PFC ensemble by replacing the random phase and permutation operators with their pseudorandom counterparts. - Adaptive pseudorandom isometries. We show that if one considers isometries (rather than unitaries) from n to n + \omega(log n) qubits, a small modification of our PRU construction achieves adaptive security, i.e.~even a distinguisher that can query the isometry adaptively in sequence cannot distinguish it from Haar random isometries. This gives the first construction of adaptive pseudorandom isometries. Under an additional conjecture, this proof also extends to adaptive PRUs.</div></div></div></li><li value=133><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Heralded entanglement of solid-state qubits at metropolitan scale</div><div class=paper-authors>Arian Stolk (QuTech, Delft University of Technology);

Recent works have explored the concept of certifying nonlocal correlations over extended distances through the use of a local Bell test. Here, an additional quantum device is placed in close proximity to one party, using short-distance correlations to verify nonlocal behavior at long distances. However, existing works have either not resolved the question of DIQKD security against active attackers in this setup, or used methods that do not yield tight bounds on the keyrates. In this work, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate computation task in this setup that can be combined with recently developed methods for analyzing standard DIQKD. Using this method, we show that if the short-distance devices exhibit sufficiently high detection efficiencies, positive key rates can be achieved in the long-distance branch with lower detection efficiencies as compared to standard DIQKD setups.

The key idea is to use the Bell violation of the raw data, instead of its min-entropy, as the extractor promise.</div></div></div></li><li value=12><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Randomness extractors for quantum cryptography and an analysis of their effect using statistical testing</div><div class=paper-authors>Cameron Foreman (University College London & Quantinuum);

Our study explores an entanglement-based one-sided device-independent QKD scenario, where one party's device is semi-trusted, while the second is completely untrusted. We introduce specific assumptions about the semi-trusted device's measurements and assess the security of our protocol without post-selecting outcomes, thereby allowing one to prove security against coherent attacks. By applying the latest analytical and numerical methods, we established that our protocol can securely operate as long as the involved detection efficiencies exceed a minimal threshold of 50.1% specifically on the untrusted side. This is almost the theoretical limit achievable for protocols with two untrusted measurements and is within current experimental capabilities. Interestingly, we also show that, by placing the source of states close to the untrusted side, our protocol is secure over distances comparable to standard QKD protocols.

However, the security analysis and parameter estimation of CV QKD are complicated due to the infinite-dimensional latent Hilbert space. Also, the transmission of strong reference pulses undermines the security and complicates the experiments. In this work, we tackle these two problems by presenting a time-bin-encoding CV protocol with a simple phase-error-based security analysis valid under general coherent attacks. With the key encoded into the relative intensity between two optical modes, the need for global references is removed. Furthermore, phase randomization can be introduced to decouple the security analysis of different photon-number components. We can hence tag the photon number for each round, effectively estimate the associated privacy using a carefully designed coherent-detection method, and independently extract encryption keys from each component. Simulations manifest that the protocol using multi-photon components increases the key rate by two orders of magnitude compared to the one using only the single-photon component.

However, the efficacy of QCKA is hampered by inherent losses in optical fibers and the increasing number of users, impacting both bit rate and range. Here we introduce multi-field (MF) QCKA scheme, where independently sets of phase-randomized optical fields are generated at remote locations, later combining them at a central measuring station. Employing the post-measurement pairing technique, we post-select optical fields with the same random phase, establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger correlations to distill a secret conference key. This method ensures that the communication efficiency of MF-QCKA scales linearly with communication transmittance and remains independent of the number of users. Using components similar to twin-field quantum key distribution, MF-QCKA can be implemented in a practial and scalable fashion. For three-user scenario, our protocol can overcome the performance limitation of QCKA without quantum memory in the finite regime.

Fehr et. al. proposed a CA protocol with pre-shared basis information between the client and server which has a nice key recycling property, where secrets including the pre-shared basis can be securely reused after each successful round. We extend the protocol to a practical setting by including decoy state and error correction, but the leakage of pre-shared basis information via multi-photon events limits the performance of such a protocol. As such, we propose the use of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), assumed to be secure only during each run of the protocol, to perform basis selection to reduce information leakage. A formal proof of the protocol security is provided by modifying the entropic uncertainty relation to account for basis generated by a PRNG, which could be of independent interest as it may be applicable to other protocols such as quantum key distribution. An experimental implementation of the protocol, with appropriate post-selection, was performed to demonstrate its feasibility. We also designed a CA protocol secure in the practical setting with only two rounds of communication: a challenge by the server and a response by the client.</div></div></div></li><li value=45><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Networking quantum networks with minimum cost aggregation</div><div class=paper-authors>Koji Azuma (NTT Basic Research Laboratories)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a style=color:#4c9cde onclick='return $("#abstract-45").toggle(200),!1'>[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-45 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> A quantum internet holds promise for achieving distributed quantum sensing and large-scale quantum computer networks, as well as quantum communication among arbitrary clients all over the globe.

Although analyses addressing this issue have been recently proposed, they only consider a restrictive scenario in which the correlations have a finite and known maximum length that is much smaller than the total number of emitted signals. While it is expected that the magnitude of the correlations decreases as the pulse separation increases, the assumption that this magnitude is exactly zero after a certain point does not seem to have any physical justification. Concerningly, this means that existing analyses cannot guarantee the security of current QKD implementations. Here, we solve this pressing problem by developing a general framework that can handle pulse correlations of unbounded length. Our framework allows us to directly use existing proofs addressing this imperfection without the need to construct them from scratch, thus reestablishing the security of QKD in a simple and versatile manner.</div></div></div></li><li value=59><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Verification of Quantum Computations without Trusted Preparations or Measurements</div><div class=paper-authors>Elham Kashefi (School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh / LIP6, CNRS, Sorbonne Université);

Most realizations follow this logic: Alice prepares random quantum states, measures them to extract random numbers, and then uses them to modulate the state of the transmitted light. The alternative approach is passive state preparation. It was proposed in 2010 and recently studied for security aspects. The idea is to use the natural phase randomness of the laser pulses to prepare random states. This approach can help to solve the security problem of correlating the state modulation voltage. Originally, the focus was on preparing the polarization state. This required two lasers or an additional intensity modulator. In this work, we use a laser that generates random phase pairs of subsequent pulses as a ready-to-use qubit. This allows us to simplify the Alice device. To perform a full phase characterization, we split a portion of the signal, convert it to polarization, and perform polarization tomography where we postselect four BB84 states. Without a decoy state, this QKD system is well suited for the last mile of a star quantum network with a loss budget of up to 10 dB. We have experimentally demonstrated passive state QKD over 10km deployed and spool fiber obtaining 10-100 bps of secret key correspondingly.</div></div></div></li><li value=61><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>A security framework for quantum key distribution implementations</div><div class=paper-authors>Guillermo Currás-Lorenzo (University of Vigo);

In a threshold scheme, the secret-key is split among multiple parties in order to protect the key. Our first observation is a security analysis in the superposition-access model might be needed for a multi-party threshold scheme in the post-quantum setting since a corrupt party may deliver its secret key to a quantum adversary. Consequently, the adversary can implement a partial evaluation of the multi-party threshold scheme on his quantum device and this can enforce a superposition access to the underlying primitive. In other words, if the underlying primitive is vulnerable to a superposition attack, then the security of the multi-party threshold scheme might break. For instance, under a reasonable assumption we show that the NPR's threshold pseudorandom function (Naor et al.

Although security can be certified from correlations with minimal assumptions in the device-independent scenario, the performance of such protocols is currently limited. This limitation motivates the exploration of sequential measurements, that is, defined with precise temporal ordering, as a means of improving performance through the reuse of the quantum states. To date, the study of sequential quantum protocols has been modest, lacking a comprehensive mathematical framework to explore the properties of the obtainable correlations. In this study, we adopt a geometric perspective to investigate sequential quantum correlations, providing a general mathematical framework. Here, we analytically prove a Tsirelson-like boundary for sequential quantum correlations, expressed as a trade-off between the amount of nonlocality shared by each sequential user. This boundary is particularly beneficial for the generation of secure quantum randomness. Indeed, observing a correlation on it can certify the maximum attainable bits per state in the case of one remote party and two sequential parties. In contrast to all previous schemes, this can happen even if one of the sequential users does not share any nonlocality. We demonstrate that this quantum boundary can be reached with a simple qubit protocol and investigate numerically the robustness of randomness generation under realistic noise conditions, finding that it greatly improved compared to previous proposals. Our proof-of-concept photonic implementation of the protocol confirms experimentally that our approach certifies more bits per state compared to the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenario for the same noise, affirming both feasibility and robustness. This study marks a significant advance in understanding sequential quantum correlations, offering valuable insights and new mathematical tools for further fundamental studies and practical applications of efficient device-independent protocols.</div></div></div></li><li value=75><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Increasing Secret Key Rate in Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution using 4×4 Port Detection Network</div><div class=paper-authors>Ishan Pandey (Indian Institute of Science / Indian Space Research Organisation);

Depending on the input, the preparation device sends either a weak coherent state (x=1) or a vacuum state (x=0). The measurement device employs homodyne detection to distinguish between these states, and the output value is chosen when the detector current is below (b=0) or above (b=1) a certain threshold. In order to certify the quantum origin of the randomness generated by output b, we need to track the correlations between input and output and the average energy per pulse must respect an upper bound. By using a continuous wave laser to seed the pulsed laser that generates the states, we avoid the need for expensive electro-optical modulators as used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08307. With this scheme we achieve an extraction rate of certified quantum randomness of around 625kHz.</div></div></div></li><li value=80><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Advantage of multi-partite entanglement for quantum cryptography over long and short ranged networks</div><div class=paper-authors>Janka Memmen (Technische Universität Berlin);

We present rigorous results that address both these challenges. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks in terms of extractable secret bits per network use. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.</div></div></div></li><li value=82><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>CVQKD payload and receiver for SPOQC mission</div><div class=paper-authors>Rupesh Kumar (Univeristy of York)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a style=color:#4c9cde onclick='return $("#abstract-82").toggle(200),!1'>[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-82 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will present the research and development of a quantum payload constructed for the Satellite Platform for Optical Quantum Communications (SPOQC) - a CubeSat mission by the Quantum Communication Hub, UK, scheduled for launch in 2025.

The main result of our paper is that the regularized key of formation is an upper bound on the key cost of a quantum state. The core protocol underlying this result is privacy dilution, which converts states containing ideal privacy into ones with diluted privacy.

We further focus on mixed-state analogues of pure quantum states in the domain of privacy, and we prove that a number of entanglement measures are equal to each other for these states, similar to the case of pure entangled states.

Recently, Chaturvedi, Viola, and Pawlowski (CVP) arXiv:2211.14231 introduced a variation of standard Bell experiments, which we call routed Bell experiments, with the goal of extending the range over which quantum nonlocality can be demonstrated. In these experiments, in some of the rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. CVP showed that there are quantum correlations in routed Bell experiments such that the outcomes of the remote device cannot be classically predetermined, even when its detection efficiency is arbitrarily low. In our work, we show that the correlations considered by CVP, though they cannot be classically predetermined, do not require the transmission of quantum systems to the remote device. This leads us to properly define the concept of 'short-range' and 'long-range' quantum correlations in routed Bell experiments. We then explore the conditions under which short-range quantum correlations can be ruled out. We find that routed Bell experiments do allow for reducing the detection efficiency threshold but the improvements are smaller than those suggested by CVP's analysis. We then investigate DIQKD protocols based on the routed setup. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using non-commutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. We find that in an ideal case routed DIQKD protocols can significantly improve detection efficiency requirements, by up to 30%, compared to their non-routed counterparts. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as 50% for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any DIQKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.</div></div></div></li><li value=94><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Optical-pumping attack on a laser source in quantum key distribution</div><div class=paper-authors>Maksim Fadeev (Russian Quantum Center);

But there are vulnerabilities in the technical implementation of systems. Laser seeding attack is one of the examples of imperfections in QKD systems. Recent works have demonstrated that Eve can manipulate output power of Alice's laser. This leads to an increase of the average photon number, emitted by Alice. But this attack can be prevented by using passive fiber-optic elements such as isolators or DWDM-filters. In this work, we demonstrate a new kind of attack namely, the optical pumping attack. This attack utilises imperfections in passive optic elements that are used in QKD systems to prevent other types of attack. Eve can use source at different wavelength to seed Alice laser, 1064 nm for example. This radiation would be absorbed by crystal within laser and create additional population inversion to inversion created by bias current, that drives Alice laser. This pumping would change average photon number at the output of Alice, leading to wrong estimation of lower bound on the secret key rate. This creates a side-channel for Eve for obtaining key information. In this work we performed this kind of attack for several wavelengths: 1064 nm, 1310 nm, 1480 nm and 2000 nm, measured changing of pulse energy, average output power and pulse shape under attacks at different wavelengths. Finally, we provide theoretical estimation of required isolation at the tested wavelengths to protect the source against the optical-pumping attack.</div></div></div></li><li value=95><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>On Classical Data Encryption in QKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Valeria Pastushenko (Terra Quantum AG)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a style=color:#4c9cde onclick='return $("#abstract-95").toggle(200),!1'>[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-95 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> Classical communication between legitimate users in conventional QKD protocols is assumed to be open and fully known by a potential eavesdropper.

Polarization encoding is acknowledged for its dependability and low error rate, rendering it ideal for free-space links, whereas time-bin encoding is robust to birefringence, thereby making it suitable for optical fiber networks. The strength of polarization-based protocols is based on the full characterization of the receiver, to reconstruct the information encoded in the shared qubits. This is typically achieved through tomographic analysis, which adds to the complexity of the final protocol. In this research, we introduce a unique cross-encoded method, where high precision quantum states are produced using a self-regulating, calibration-free polarization modulator and then conveyed through a polarization-to-time-bin converter. A hybrid receiver is used to carry out both time-of-arrival and polarization measurements for decoding the quantum states.

High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, higher QBER increases the minimum raw key length necessary for non-zero secret key length extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and post-processing overheads. We show that recent developments in finite key analysis allow three different small-satellite-based QKD projects CQT-Sat, UK-QUARC-ROKS, and QEYSSat to produce secret keys even under very high loss conditions, improving on estimates based on previous finite key bounds.

While one-way functions are essentially the minimal assumption in classical cryptography, this is not the case in the quantum setting. A variety of qualitatively weaker and inherently quantum assumptions (e.g. EFI pairs, one-way state generators, and pseudorandom states) are known to be sufficient for non-trivial quantum cryptography. While it is known that commitments, zero-knowledge proofs, and even multiparty computation can be constructed from these assumptions, it has remained an open question whether the same is true for quantum digital signatures schemes (QDS). In this work, we show that there does not exist a black-box construction of a QDS scheme with classical signatures from pseudorandom states with linear, or greater, output length. Our result complements that of Morimae and Yamakawa (2022), who described a one-time secure QDS scheme with classical signatures, but left open the question of constructing a standard multi-time secure one.</div></div></div></li><li value=120><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>A reconfigurable multi-user quantum network with ground to space link</div><div class=paper-authors>Stephane Vinet (Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo);

One of those is the time-shift attack that exploits mismatches in temporal responses of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to control the receiver’s detection. Zhao’s group demonstrated the time-shift attack successfully in 2008. The time-shift attack can be realized with current technology, and it will threaten the secure key distribution. We propose a simple and effective countermeasure to the time-shift attack by connecting additional APDs to detection ports through beamsplitters to average temporal responses of APDs. This method can reduce the photon detection mismatches between port 0 and port 1.

QKD only with passive devices is desirable to prevent side-channel attacks possible in the case of use of active devices such as modulators. The Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol is a strong candidate for an implementation with satisfying these; it can be implemented using time bins with a passive delayed interferometer that inevitably generates "satellite time bins", two pulses outside the phase-interference timing. Although time-bin encoding BB84 has been frequently demonstrated, there is no consensus whether satellite time bins can be used to extract a key. Besides, there is no security proof for either case. Here, we prove the security of time-bin encoding BB84 protocol with a passive delayed interferometer and threshold detectors. If satellite time bins are used for key generation, we show that an additional operation is necessary for security. The result is not limited only to BB84 but can be applied to Bennett-Brassard-Mermin 1992 and quantum conference key agreement based on time bins.</div></div></div></li><li value=169><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Long-distance device-independent conference key agreement</div><div class=paper-authors>Makoto Ishihara (Keio University);

G. Kwiat developed high-intensity entangled photon pair sources. In 2000, C. Simon and D. Bouwmeester theoretically studied the multi-photon effects of entangled photon pairs. Such research provides valuable tools for designing and analyzing longdistance entanglement distribution experiments in high-loss regime or satellite-to-ground QKD systems, which require high-intensity entangled photon pair sources. In this study, unlike previous papers that analyzed only specific scenarios, we numerically presented measurement results achievable through analysis in general scenarios. Based on these measured probability values, we confirmed that the results of state tomography. To prepare entangled photon pair sources, the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) phenomenon is commonly utilized. A notable characteristic of this SPDC phenomenon is that as the intensity of the incident pump beam increases, the quantum state tends to take the form of a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. In this scenario, where photons corresponding to each arm of the quantum state, namely the idler and signal photons, are distributed to Alice and Bob, respectively, the quantum state undergoing loss channels can be analyzed in the beam splitter scheme. Leveraging this fact, we analytically calculated the probability values of measurement outcomes in a general scenario where Alice and Bob each have different loss channels and measurement bases are determined by their choices. Here, we assumed that both of Alice and Bob employ systems utilizing two threshold detectors for photon measurements. Analyzing the computed measurement outcomes reveals that the resulting state always takes the form of the Werner state, regardless of factors such as the intensity of the entangled photon pair source, channel losses, and the relative measurement basis angles of Alice and Bob. This suggests that even in long-distance entanglement distribution experiments in high-loss regime, the optimization and preservation of measurement bases using twirling techniques can be applied effectively, even when using high-intensity entangled photon pair sources.</div></div></div></li><li value=171><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>High-count-rate single photon detection system using multi-pixel SSPD with SFQ circuit and FPGA TDC</div><div class=paper-authors>Toshimori Honjo (NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation);

In the last two decades, much effort has been devoted to closing the gap between the models and practical implementations in order to account for device imperfections and counter the resulting side-channel attacks. As a result, the topic of evaluating and certifying QKD systems against these attacks is increasingly coming to the forefront. This last step however presents its own challenges, currently hindering the widespread adoption of QKD. In this work, we lay at the intersection between theory and practice, focusing on the process of preparing an in-house QKD system for evaluation. We first present a consolidated and accessible security proof for the one-decoy and two-decoy state BB84 protocols, which serves as a baseline for our QKD system. Building on this security proof, we identify the critical side-channels by evaluating the risk of most of today's known attacks. We then tackle the most critical attacks by discussing existing countermeasures that can be implemented both in the QKD system and within the security proof, where applicable. In this process, we develop new methods to characterize and evaluate QKD systems, which can later be used in evaluation laboratories. Evaluating the security of QKD systems additionally involves performing attacks to potentially identify new loopholes. Thus, we also aim to perform the first real-time Trojan horse attack on a decoy state BB84 system, further highlighting the need for robust countermeasures. By providing a critical evaluation of our QKD system and incorporating robust countermeasures against side-channel attacks, our research contributes to advancing the practical implementation and evaluation of QKD as a trusted security solution.</div></div></div></li><li value=179><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>In-orbit dark count rate performance and radiation damage high-temperature annealing of silicon avalanche photodiode single-photon detectors of Micius satellite</div><div class=paper-authors>Meng Yang (Hefei National Laboratory);

This is one of the limitations of this technology, implying long times for sharing cryptographic keys. One of the solutions for this problem consists in simply sending more pulses in less time, that is to say, increasing the bit rate. However, this solution has a problem when it comes to discrete variable QKD systems using single photon detectors, especially with semiconductor Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs). Commercially available SPADs introduce high temporal jitter to the measurements, increasing the probability of inter-symbol interference. Temporal jitter can produce measurements of a bit in the temporal window of previous or next bits, which may generate measurement errors increasing the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). This means that we achieve higher bit rates but we may also increase QBER, decreasing secure bit rate, imposing a limit in the bit rate. In this work, we model the effect of temporal jitter on the QBER, validate the model with actual measurements, and use the model to study the effect of temporal jitter on high-speed QKD systems. In the case of commercial SPADs, with standard deviation values for the temporal jitter near 150 ps, the optimum bit rate is about few GHz. In order to operate at higher speeds we need single photon detectors with less jitter, what we can achieve with superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD).</div></div></div></li><li value=184><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Quantum Data Centres in the Presence of Noise</div><div class=paper-authors>Kenny Campbell (School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Leeds);

With this architecture, the intra-QPU noise is kept small, but additional noise is introduced due to the latency of and imperfections in the inter-QPU links. Understanding the trade-offs between these different types of noise is essential for guiding future efforts in QDC manufacture and compilation. We develop and use a classical simulator to emulate the execution of different quantum circuits on an imperfect QDC. An individual inter-QPU CNOT gate is first-considered and then a selection of larger circuits are investigated.

Among them, parameter estimation is an important means of evaluating system parameters, and provides parameter basis for subsequent key extraction processes. However, the existed methods usually divide the free space into several relatively stable subchannels and use sampling estimation to achieve parameter estimation, which are limited by the quality and quantity of statistical samples. Here, we firstly propose a free-space parameter estimation scheme based on Bayesian estimation. Experiment has been proven that Bayesian schemes has advantages in estimation accuracy and stability compared to sampling statistical schemes, and has good performance in both free space and fiber channels, with high robustness and accuracy. Moreover, key reconciliation is also a highly anticipated aspect of CVQKD post-processing. But when the signal-to-noise ratio of the quantum channel changes, constant-bit-rate correction codes lead to a decrease in reconciliation efficiency, further deteriorating the system performance. We further propose a rate-adaptive Polar code reconciliation scheme and a scheme based on intermediate channel low-density parity check code cascaded polar code (IC-LDPC Polar code) to improve reconciliation efficiency and cope with practical long-distance CVQKD systems.</div></div></div></li><li value=189><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Advantages and limitations of channel multiplexing for discrete-variable quantum key distribution</div><div class=paper-authors>Mikolaj Lasota (Nicolaus Copernicus University);

However, the distribution of entanglement over long distances is challenging due to propagation losses and instability. Time-bin entanglement is a promising solution since it is robust in long-distance distribution over fiber optics and immune to the polarization distortion such a channel can introduce. Time-bin has also been demonstrated to be compatible with NV center-based quantum technologies, representing a crucial interface between the different devices in quantum networks. Nevertheless, its most common implementation suffers from a post-selection loophole (PSL), which invalidates Bell non-locality tests and renders it vulnerable to quantum hacking attacks, thus preventing its use for device-independent protocols. We present a scheme using optical switches to obtain only detection events displaying non-local interference, thereby closing the PSL. Our scheme works with 1550nm biphotons for entanglement distribution over existing fiber-based telecom networks. The switches show a high extinction ratio of up to 30dB and stability over extended periods. We also measure interferometric visibilities of over 94%, which corresponds to a CHSH S parameter of 2.65</div></div></div></li><li value=195><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION AND IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE HONG-OU-MANDEL EFFECT</div><div class=paper-authors>Inés Meili Díaz García (Spanish National Research Council (CSIC);

However, not all QKD setups fulfill the ideal model requirements, since imperfections in real devices have been proved to make the secret exchange vulnerable to certain attacks. These types of vulnerabilities are overcome by new Measurement Device Independent (MDI) QKD protocols, which protect the security against detector side-channel attacks and enable secure communication over longer distances. As such, the MDI-QKD protocol involves a third-party relay (Charlie) who might be under the control of an eavesdropper and to which Alice and Bob send their states for the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to take place. The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is a quantum interference phenomenon between two indistinguishable photons at a beam splitter that bears significant weight within the context of Bell state measurements and is crucial for the security of MDI-QKD and its realistic implementation. In this work, we put together an experimental setup to observe and monitor the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. By synchronizing two indistinguishable weak coherent pulses (WCP) to arrive simultaneously at a 50:50 beam splitter (following (2)), it has been possible to verify that the two photons exit together through the same output only if the quantum interference takes place. Consequently, detection event occurs at just one detector. The most significant experimental evidence of such effect is the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip (3), a plot representing the number of coincidence detections against the temporal delay induced in one of the pulses. It should be noted that, since we are using WCPs instead of photon number states, the interference contrast is 50%. We successfully attested to the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect by obtaining a clear and pronounced dip. To enhance its visibility, we varied and tested several experimental components. These results thus obtained, along with the discussion of the experimental techniques relevant to test such a phenomenon, provide valuable insights for future advancements in quantum interference studies in the context of quantum communications.

In designing a HQSS for multi-node satellite communication network, we consider a group of at least four satellites (A, B, C, D), in linear quantum network configuration, where qubit generation and measurement occur at the endpoint Satellites A and D respectively, with two intermediate satellites B and C limited to single-qubit measurement and unitary transforms. This setting will restrict the two intermediate satellites B and C to allow using lower powers needing the cooperation from the endpoint Satellites A and D, however, endpoint Satellite D utilizes the higher powers to reconstruct the secret without the measurement outcome of one of the lower power intermediate Satellite B or C. The hierarchical structure depends on the trusted (end node Satellite D) or untrusted (intermediate Satellite B, C) locations within a satellite quantum network. Our motivation is to use this hierarchical power for long-distance QSS, allowing leading Satellite A to securely share a quantum secret to Satellite D while bypassing one of the intermediate satellites B or C. Satellite A utlizes a 4-qubit cluster quantum entangled state with Satellites B, C, and D to perform HQSS in Qline architecture. The simplicity of hardware at intermediate nodes in the Qline architecture facilitates easier implementation of proposed HQSS for multi-node satellites. Our HQSS based on Q-line configuration shows that hierarchy (2) with minimal hardware (1, 3) would be the standard requirements in future terrestrial and non-terrestrial quantum networks (2, 3). Further, we also explore the links of our proposed HQSS protocol to semi-quantum (classical) regime (3) operated by intermediate satellite nodes. Moreover, unlike traditional QKD networks, our design based on Qline architecture doesn't require key routing through intermediate nodes, enhancing security by avoiding exposure to these nodes, without consuming established keys for routing security. Rather established keys can be efficiently consumed by a leading Satellite A to securely distributed the entanglement among intermediate Satellites B, C and endpoint Satellite D nodes. As the security of key establishment on Qline networks is composable (1), ensuring that established keys can be utilized for secure entanglement distribution executed by Satellite A among inter-satellite quantum communication network, thereby advancing larger constellations securely.

Major progress has recently been made in the finite-size regime against independent and identical (iid) collective attacks (Kanitschar, F. et. al., (2023), PRX Quantum, 4(4), p.040306). However, a complete and rigorous analysis must take into account correlated rounds of attack beyond the iid-collective assumption, and must not assume a photon-number cutoff on the signal states. The difficulty of achieving this lies in the absence of an information-theoretic framework for proving security that handles infinite dimensional multipartite quantum states that are a priori unstructured, i.e., beyond the asymptotic iid setting. We present a composable security proof against coherent attacks in the finite-size regime for a general DMCVQKD protocol. We introduce a framework to handle states that are in part iid and in part unstructured (almost iid) in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We use a de Finetti reduction for infinite dimensional almost iid states (Renner, R., Cirac, J. I., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 110504 (2009)), and generalise the acceptance test and the energy test to almost iid states handling Eve’s correlated infinite dimensional side information. As work in progress, we address the issue of a missing chain rule that formulates an explicit key rate expression.

Low-propagation loss materials, such as LiNbO3, SiNx, Si, AlN, allow for high-efficiency waveguide-based optical circuits, including phase/intensity modulator, beam splitter, and polarization controller, on a semiconductor wafer. To realize a QPIC-based QKD chip, photodetectors should be integrated onto optical circuits fabricated with low propagation loss materials. In this study, we discuss the heterogeneous integration technology of III-V photodetectors on low propagation loss materials. Particularly, we demonstrated InGaA/InAs/InGaAs quantum well (InAs QW) phototransistors integrated onto Si substrates through wafer bonding and layer transfer techniques. Our InAs QW phototransistors can detect low-intensity light at a wavelength of 1.55 um owing to their photoconductive gain based on photovoltaic effects. The photovoltaic effects in phototransistor induce a threshold voltage shift because the holes accumulate in the transistor body under light illumination. The threshold voltage shift results in a higher photocurrent than the number of photo-generated carriers under light illumination at a 1.55 um wavelength. This implies that high transconductance is desirable to obtain a high photocurrent for the phototransistor. We achieved the high responsivity in our phototransistors by optimizing InAs channel structure featuring superior transconductance characteristics (2). For future work, we will integrate InAs QW photodetectors with membrane and nanowire structures onto waveguide-based optical circuits fabricated with low propagation loss materials. We believe that our proposed phototransistor will help to demonstrate a high performance power monitoring system in QPIC.</div></div></div></li><li value=200><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>All forms of QKD are susceptible to memory attacks</div><div class=paper-authors>Ernest Y.-Z.

We highlight in this work that device-dependent or measurement-device-independent protocols are in fact also susceptible to similar attacks. Furthermore, even if we only consider a single protocol instance, memory effects across rounds are enough to cause substantial difficulties in applying many existing non-IID proof techniques for device-dependent or measurement-device-independent protocols, such as de Finetti reductions and complementarity-based arguments (e.g. analysis of phase errors). We present a quick discussion of these issues, including some tailored scenarios where protocols admitting security proofs via those techniques become insecure when memory effects are allowed, and we highlight connections to recently discussed attacks on DIQKD protocols that have public announcements based on the measurement outcomes. This discussion indicates the challenges that would need to be addressed in order to apply those techniques in the presence of memory effects (for either the device-dependent or device-independent case), whether for devices reused across multiple protocol instances, or for a single protocol instance.</div></div></div></li><li value=201><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Towards genuine randomness in the presence of experimental imperfections</div><div class=paper-authors>Jose Manuel Aguero Trejo (The University of Auckland)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a style=color:#4c9cde onclick='return $("#abstract-201").toggle(200),!1'>[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-201 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> The generation of random numbers has an essential role in cryptography, with most practical applications still relying on Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs).

For this reason, we designed a QRNG protocol that generates maximally unpredictable strings by localising value indefiniteness, therefore having a provable advantage over any PRNG. Moreover, a photonic implementation without the need for entanglement is possible for this approach, making it suitable for practical applications. However, the role of errors in an operational photonic embodiment is yet to be fully understood.

Quantum game theory offers potentially beneficial properties to games that cannot be realised in their classical counterparts.

Offering a theoretically secure way to share secret keys between parties, QKD state of the art has witnessed remarkable progress in the last years. Nonetheless, although theoretically secure, QKD is not implementation-secure and until now, the study of physical vulnerabilities in QKD setups has mainly focused on the optical channel. The concept of attacking a cryptographic system via its physical characteristics and associated leakages, known as side-channel analysis, was firstly introduced in classical cryptography, with the seminal work of Paul Kosher. Since then, power and electromagnetic side-channel analysis have become a staple in classical cryptanalysis. However, these concepts have hardly been applied to QKD. In this work, we propose and implement a new method for side-channel analysis on QKD systems, by exploiting the power consumption of the electronic driver controlling the electro-optical components of the QKD transmitter. For high-rate transmission, QKD modules typically require electronic drivers, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Here, we will show that the FPGA's power consumption can leak information about the QKD operation, and consequently the transmitted key. The analysis was performed on the QKD transmitter at the University of Padua. Our results are consistent and show critical information leakage, having reached a maximum accuracy of 73.35% in the prediction of transmitted random keys at 100 MHz repetition frequency.</div></div></div></li><li value=206><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Secure Implementation and Verification of a Certifiable Source Device Independent Quantum Random Number Generator</div><div class=paper-authors>Kaiwei Qiu (School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore);

Among their advantages, they are essentially immune to information leakage, including that potentially induced by an adversary via e.g. a Trojan-horse attack. However, practical implementations of these transmitters emit, in addition to the desired signals, some extra pulses that are not used as quantum carriers, but still may contain sensitive information about the intensity and bit/basis encoding of the signals. This unwanted pulses can be actively blocked with an intensity modulator (or an optical switch), but the extinction ratio of these devices is always finite, and thus it is still crucial to account for the residual amount of information leakage at the security-proof level. In this work, we analyze the security of these transmitters and evaluate their performance in the presence of this kind of inherent information leakage. We find that the secret-key rate of the protocol is severely affected when the information leakage is not sufficiently attenuated, which highlights the importance of accounting for such type of imperfections.</div></div></div></li><li value=209><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Performance Degradation in Polarizationn Encoded Quantum Key Distribution by Polarization Dependent Loss</div><div class=paper-authors>Kyongchun Lim (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute);

The systems mainly are implemented based on bulk-optics. The bulk-optics based implementation has large volume, heavy weight, high power consumption, and high cost, so that it is not easy to compatible to current communication system and is hard to be commercialized. In order to overcome the aforementioned, recently photonic integrated chip (PIC) based implementation of QKD systems have been proposed. Unfortunately, PIC based implementation has inevitable polarization depende loss (PDL), which can be induced by imperfect fabrication of waveguide, or plasma dispersion effect which can change absorption in case of a polarization modulator. Additionally, a QKD system currently cannot be implemented with only PIC so that it requires additional optical components that has PDL as well. PDL may cause the severe performance degradation of QKD, by destroying the mutually unbiasedness between the states in QKD and increasing quantum bit error rate (QBER). In this study, we analyze effect of PDL in QKD. First, we experimentally analyze state change of polarization qubit depending on PDL which can be emulated by a PDL emulator. Based on this, we theoretically calculate intrinsic quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the corresponding secure key rate of QKD.</div></div></div></li><li value=210><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Integrated Photonic Self-Testing QRNG</div><div class=paper-authors>Maria Ana Afonso Pereira (University of Geneva);

This is necessary due to afterpulsing, an effect which causes spurious detections due to the thermal excitation of trapped charge carriers in defect states in the SPAD.

This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, thus invalidating a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here, we experimentally characterize intensity correlations between the nearest-neigbouring optical pulses in two commercial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In addition, we study intensity correlations between pulses spaced further apart (higher-order correlations) and find that, in contrast to what has been conjectured, their impact on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of the nearest-neighbour (first-order) correlations.</div></div></div></li><li value=215><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>An auto-calibrated time-to-digital converter for Quantum Communication</div><div class=paper-authors>Matías Rubén Bolaños Wagner (Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Università degli Studi di Padova, Via Gradenigo 6B - 35131 Padova, Italy);

In this regime, there are two standard practical implementations: the transmitted local oscillator (TLO) and the local-local oscillator (LLO), where the LLO has recently reached 100km in laboratory-based fibre. Despite this success, the LLO also suffers major disadvantages like reduced quantum signal bandwidth capacity. Typically, only 50% of the transmission is for exchanging common phase references between Alice and Bob using reference signals. Subsequently, the key rate is reduced by half over all the transmission distances. In this work, we propose using a machine learning algorithm such as Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to predict the reference phase. The algorithm is trained with a sufficient number of phase reference data. Then, it predicts the phase drift with minimal usage of the reference signals, thereby reducing the reference signal bandwidth and increasing the key rate.</div></div></div></li><li value=221><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Implementations of QKD security in different use-cases</div><div class=paper-authors>Ilaria Vagniluca (QTI s.r.l.);

The security of QKD relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics, making it a crucial technology for achieving highly secure data transmission, in particular in the quantum computer era. Among the impediments of the use of QKD in complex and inter-connected networks is the limited key rate provided by such system, the limited distance between two nodes that want to communicate and the need of confidentiality within the trusted relay. When QKD is implemented in large size networks, running on long distances, the usual solution is to use a lot of intermediate nodes with the consequence of reducing the performance and increasing the need of security inside these intermediate nodes. However, it is still extremely interesting for a user to implement the QKD in such types of topologies because of the high security it allows despite the limitation in bandwidth and the complexity in network topology. We propose a new approach to solve the above-mentioned problems. The core of the solution is to develop a key distribution system that can operate in a new mode; multiplying the bandwidth, in any network topology, while basing the overall security on QKD-exchanged keys.</div></div></div></li><li value=223><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Practical Implementation of a Quantum-augmented Communications Network</div><div class=paper-authors>W.

TF-QKD requires single photon interference between two independent optical fields transmitted through different channels. In free-space channels, atmospheric turbulence strongly disturbs the laser beam's wavefront, leading to a significant intensity fluctuation of received photons. This random fluctuation causes intensity distinguishability between two beams, thus reducing the visibility of interference and the secure key rate. Here, we proposed a scheme to increase the secure key rate under such unstable channels. The characteristics, especially the intensity fluctuation, of free-space channels are presented. Numerical analysis is performed to demonstrate the improvement of the secure key rate with our strategy. The result shows that, under a typical atmospheric condition of 14 km distance, the secure key rate of TF-QKD can be increased to 3.75 times. Our method can be a general tool widely used in the future long-distance horizontal or satellite-based free-space quantum key distribution.</div></div></div></li><li value=244><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Toward Certifiable QKD: Addressing Side Channels and Implementation Attacks in a Standardized Testing Framework</div><div class=paper-authors>Florian Prawits (Austrian Institute of Technology);

Furthermore, we propose a structured approach for developing standardized tests to evaluate the robustness of QKD systems against these vulnerabilities.

Early quantum networks are expected to be deployed on pre-existing infrastructure, sharing resources with classical networks, and thus can benefit from compatible design principles and behaviours. In particular, most of the research on quantum repeater networks based on entanglement distribution assume that some connection is established in order to reserve resources for the distribution attempt. However, the most prominent classical network, the Internet, is built upon the concept of connectionless communications, and therefore this approach might not be ideal for the early stages of deployment. In our work, we investigate the performance of connectionless protocols over quantum networks. To do so, we consider both unencoded (standard) but deterministic repeaters, and repeaters using a 3-quit repetition code. We analyse the achievable secret key rates for both of these setups in different regimes of errors. Our results suggest that error correction techniques such as the usage of encoded quantum repeaters will be crucial to the success of early quantum networks.</div></div></div></li><li value=246><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Hybrid encoder for discrete and continuous variable QKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Mattia Sabatini (University of Padova);

High-speed gain-switching lasers, commonly used in QKD, can exhibit residual photons causing phase correlations between consecutive pulses, challenging the perfect phase randomization assumption crucial for the decoy-state BB84 protocol. Theoretical work has proposed security proofs that require knowledge of how closely each phase's probability distribution approximates uniformity, which is complex to estimate experimentally. In this study we introduce an experimental method to characterise phase correlations of any length under realistic conditions by modelling the phase generation process within the laser cavity. Additionally, we experimentally benchmark this practical routine for measuring second-order correlations using a double Michelson interferometer with tunable amplitude attenuators, allowing comprehensive characterisation of the phase generation process and accurate measurement of the phase probability distribution, thus enhancing the security of QKD systems.</div></div></div></li><li value=248><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Finite size analysis of quantum key distribution with advantage distillation</div><div class=paper-authors>Jonas Treplin (DLR);

Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances QKD protocols by increasing error tolerance, thus extending the communication range. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer correlated bits between Alice and Bob, which exhibits a reduced QBER, while Eve's mutual information does not significantly increase. This process ultimately lowers the information disclosure in the information reconciliation step, while the relative key shortening during privacy amplification remains largely unaffected. In this study, we present the first comprehensive finite key size analysis of the decoy-state version of the BB84 protocol including AD post-processing. Our results demonstrate a notable improvement in QBER tolerance through AD, with the 1-decoy version outperforming the 2-decoy version of the protocol. This analysis has significant implications for long-distance and satellite-based QKD applications, which are constrained by QBER, as it shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved by improved post-processing techniques.</div></div></div></li><li value=249><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Port-Based State Preparation and Applications</div><div class=paper-authors>Garazi Muguruza (QuSoft, University of Amsterdam);

In the case of trusted Gaussian noises in the detectors of continuous-variable (CV) QKD, there is a method based on rescaling that is applicable to any protocol using homodyne or heterodyne detectors. Here, we are interested in what kind of CV-QKD protocols tend to benefit more from the trusted scenario. Using prior research that extended the covariance matrix analysis from Gaussian modulation to discrete modulation, we evaluated the quantitative effect of rescaling on the key rate with arbitrary modulation. Our results revealed that the performance asymptotically improves in any discrete modulation protocol, and this improvement is more significant compared to Gaussian modulation. Additionally, we developed a method to address unbalanced heterodyne measurements, where the noise and transmittance of the two homodyne detectors differ. This allows for a more realistic measurement model to be addressed with discrete modulation.</div></div></div></li><li value=253><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>A highly modular and configurable Python framework for QKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Felix Kunzmann (Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS Design Automation Division EAS);

CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. Following the classical literature on CDS for guidance, we establish closure under negation, an amplification property, and prove a number of lower bounds on CDQS based on communication complexity.</div></div></div></li></ul></section></section></div></main><footer><div class=bottom-content><div class=footer-header><div class=follow><header>Follow us</header><ul class=social-list><li><a href=https://twitter.com/Qcryptc class=social rel=noreferrer target=_blank><svg class="icon icon-twitter"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg>twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw class=social rel=noreferrer target=_blank><svg class="icon icon-youtube"><use xlink:href="#youtube"/></svg>youtube</a></li></ul></div><div class=email><a href=mailto:2024@qcrypt.net><svg class="icon icon-email"><use xlink:href="#email"/></svg>2024@qcrypt.net</a></div></div><hr><div class=footer-content><section><header>About</header><ul><li><a href="../code-of-conduct-online/index.html">Code of Conduct</a></li><li><a href="../charter/index.html">QCrypt Charter & History</a></li></ul></section><section><header>Extra Material</header><ul><li><a href="index.html">Accepted Papers</a></li><li><a href="../call/index.html">Call for Papers</a></li><li><a href="../poster/index.html">Poster, Logos and Templates</a></li></ul></section></div><hr><div class=footer-footer><a href=https://www.netlify.com target=_blank><img src="../images/logos/netlify-color-accent.svg" alt="QCrypt 2024"></a><div><a href=https://github.com/QCrypt/website-2024 target=_blank>We ❤️ sheep</a></div></div></div></footer><script src="../theme.js" async></script>
