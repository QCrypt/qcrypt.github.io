All graph state verification protocols are composably secure Léo Colisson (CWI/QuSoft, Amsterdam); Damian Markham (CNRS); Raja Yehia (ICFO) [abstract] Abstract: Graph state verification protocols allow multiple parties to share a graph state while checking that the state is honestly prepared, even in the presence of malicious parties. Since graph states are the starting point of numerous quantum protocols, it is crucial to ensure that graph state verification protocols can safely be composed with other protocols, this property being known as composable security.</description></item><item><title>AFOSR, Air Force Office of Scientific Research</title><link>/partners/old/afosr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/old/afosr/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Aliro Quantum</title><link>/partners/silver/aliro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/silver/aliro/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Anne Broadbent</title><link>/team/pcchairs/anne_broadbent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/pcchairs/anne_broadbent/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Antía Lamas-Linares</title><link>/team/org/antia_lamas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/org/antia_lamas/</guid><description/></item><item><title>APS PRX Quantum</title><link>/partners/old/apsprxq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/old/apsprxq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Artur Ekert</title><link>/team/advisory/artur_ekert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/advisory/artur_ekert/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Awards and Business Meeting</title><link>/sessions/business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/business/</guid><description>2022 PC report slides * 2022 Local organizers report: Bo-Yin Yang &amp; Kai-Min Chung (10 mins) 2022 Local organizers slides * 2024 QCrypt organizers report: Ollie Slattery, Gorjan Alagic &amp; Tom Ventsias (10 mins) 2024 report slides all slides ## Best Student Paper Awards Award slides ### Theory Congratulations to **Tony Metger** for *Generalised entropy accumulation for quantum cryptography* with co-authors Omar Fawzi ; David Sutter ; Renato Renner award ### Experiment Congratulations to **Fadri Grünenfelder** for *Towards 100 Mbps secret key rate QKD* with co-authors Alberto Boaron ; Matthieu Perrenoud ; Giovanni Resta ; Raphael Houlmann ; Sylvain El-Khoury ; Hugo Zbinden award --</description></item><item><title>Axencia Galaga de Innovacion</title><link>/partners/gold/gain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/gold/gain/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bing Qi</title><link>/team/pcchairs/bing_qi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/pcchairs/bing_qi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Call</title><link>/call/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/call/</guid><description>download and print it yourself!. -- April 2024 | TALK/POSTER SUBMISSION CLOSING SOON|-- Key Dates QCrypt 2024 (all times 23:59 AoE)

However, secure key rate of point-point quantum key distribution (QKD) is bounded by the linear rate-loss limit. Twin-field (TF) QKD can break this limit but its implementation requires global phase tracking and usually also cumbersome interferometric implementations, which are often impractical for network deployment. We remove the above shortcomings with two different solutions. In the first solution, we introduce locally generated frequency combs to stabilise an open channel, and develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games''</title><link>/sessions/invited_malavolta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_malavolta/</guid><description>Abstract: A compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally-bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers, as well as complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''CV-QKD Design for Network Integration''</title><link>/sessions/invited_brunner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_brunner/</guid><description>Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has reached a maturity that requires to consider its practical integrability into optical communication networks. As a key exchange, QKD cannot take the central role in optical network design but has to adapt to the requirements of the network. In the framework of the Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure (MadQCI) the CV-QKD prototypes of HWDU were demonstrated in operational environments. These prototypes support several key features for facilitating network integration.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Long-distance free-space MDI- &amp; TF-QKD''</title><link>/sessions/invited_cao/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_cao/</guid><description>Abstract: In principle, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security for private communication based on the laws of physics. Although attacks exist in practical QKD, many efforts have been made toward the goal of secure communication with imperfect devices. Specifically, the protocol of measure-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) guarantees the security of QKD against any detector imperfections. The decoy-state method addresses the issue of the photon number splitting (PNS) attack on an imperfect single-photon source.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Passive Quantum Key Distribution: Removing Modulator Side-Channel''</title><link>/sessions/invited_lo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_lo/</guid><description>Abstract: Modulator side channels threaten the security of quantum key distribution systems. Here, I first review a newly discovered modulator side channel for any practical bandwidth-limited modulator. After that, I present an overview of the recent development of the general theory and experiment on fully passive quantum key distribution, which removes modulator side channels completely by eliminating any modulators that carry secret information. Such a general theory is applied to different use cases: continuous variable, BB84, twin-field (TF), and measurement-device-independent (MDI)-QKD.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Photonic Integrated Circuits for qubits and qudits''</title><link>/sessions/invited_bacco/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_bacco/</guid><description>Abstract: In a society based on the continuous exchange of sensitive data and information, the importance of secure and trustable communications is essential. By exploiting principles of Quantum Physics, it is possible to share data in an unconditionally secure way, no longer based on mathematical assumptions of the encryption algorithm, but founded on the basic principles of Quantum Mechanics. In this context, my research relies on the development of a Quantum Communication (QCs) system able to increase the actual performance in terms of rate, security, and distance independently from the transmission medium.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Practical secure communication with quantum continuous variables''</title><link>/sessions/invited_diamanti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_diamanti/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Relating non-local quantum computation and information theoretic cryptography''</title><link>/sessions/invited_may/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_may/</guid><description>Abstract: Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is a cheating strategy for position-verification schemes, and is closely related to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Here, we connect NLQC to the wider context of information theoretic cryptography by relating it to a number of other cryptographic primitives. We show one special case of NLQC, known as $f$-routing, is equivalent to the quantum analogue of the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive, where by equivalent we mean that a protocol for one task gives a protocol for the other with only small overhead in resource cost.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Revocable Cryptography''</title><link>/sessions/invited_ananth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_ananth/</guid><description>Abstract: The area of revocable cryptography is concerned with representing cryptographic keys as quantum states with the guarantee that it is infeasible to give away a state representing a key without losing its functionality. Recently, many revocable cryptographic notions have been studied in the context of traditional and advanced encryption systems, signatures and pseudorandom functions. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the recent developments in revocable cryptography and mention some open problems in this area.</description></item><item><title>Ivan Damgård</title><link>/team/advisory/ivan_damgard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/advisory/ivan_damgard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jian-Wei Pan</title><link>/team/advisory/jian-wei_pan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/advisory/jian-wei_pan/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kai-Min Chung</title><link>/team/steering/kaimin_chung-copy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/steering/kaimin_chung-copy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lab Tour and Excursion to Cíes Islands (click for more details)</title><link>/sessions/__excursion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/__excursion/</guid><description>The afternoon of wednesday will consist of two possible afternoon activities.

The rapidly evolving capabilities offered by the different PIC platforms and technologies make them more and more suitable for quantum applications. This tutorial will introduce the basics of photonic integration and highlight central distinctions between optoelectronically active and passive materials.

Examples can be limitations in Hilbert space dimension, energy or fidelity. In this talk, we discuss the different assumptions used to build semi-device-independent frameworks for quantum information, how they give rise to quantum-over-classical advantages, the main types of techinques used to characterise the limitations of quantum correlations, and the applications of these resouces to cryptographic tasks such as quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.</description></item><item><title>Tutorial Talk: ''The long and winding road to the quantum internet''</title><link>/sessions/tutorial_lukens/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/tutorial_lukens/</guid><description>Abstract: Within the quantum information triumvirate of computing, sensing, and networking, quantum networks function as the glue to connect, entangle, and scale quantum resources.
