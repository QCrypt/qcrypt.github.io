However, the imperfections in realistic devices may lead to potential security risks, which must be accurately characterized and considered in practical security analysis. High-speed optical modulators, being as one of the core components of practical QKD systems, can be used to prepare the required quantum states. Here, we find that optical modulators based on LiNbO3, including phase modulators and intensity modulators, are vulnerable to photorefractive effect caused by external light injection. By changing the power of external light, eavesdroppers can control the intensities of the prepared states, posing a potential threat to the security of QKD. We have experimentally demonstrated the influence of light injection on LiNbO3-based optical modulators and analyzed the security risks caused by the potential green light injection attack, along with the corresponding countermeasures.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=38><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Implementation of a privacy preserving publicly verifiable quantum random number generator</div><div class=paper-authors>Tanvirul Islam (CQT, National University of Singapore);

A trusted device scenario assuming that an adversary has no access to imperfections in the detector is expected to provide significant improvement in the key rate, but such an endeavor so far was made separately for specific protocols and for specific proof techniques.
Here, we develop a simple and general treatment that can incorporate the effects of Gaussian trusted noises for any protocol that uses homodyne/heterodyne measurements.
In our method, a rescaling of the outcome of a noisy homodyne/heterodyne detector renders it equivalent to the outcome of a noiseless detector with a tiny additional loss, thanks to a noise-loss equivalence well-known in quantum optics. Since this method is independent of protocols and security proofs, it is applicable to Gaussian-modulation and discrete-modulation protocols and to any proof techniques developed so far and yet to be discovered as well.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=45><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>On Zero-Knowledge Proofs over the Quantum Internet</div><div class=paper-authors>Mark Carney (Quantum Village Inc.)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a style=color:#4c9cde onclick='return $("#abstract-45").toggle(200),!1'>[Abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-45 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents a new method for quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols. The logic of classical zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) due to Schnorr is applied in quantum circuits and algorithms. This novel approach gives an exact way with which a prover $P$ can prove they know some secret by encapsulating it in a quantum state before sending to a verifier $V$ by means of a quantum channel - allowing for a ZKP wherein an eavesdropper or manipulation can be detected with a fail-safe design. This is achieved by moving away from the hardness of the Discrete Logarithm Problem towards the hardness of estimating quantum states. This paper presents a method with which this can be achieved and some bounds for the security of the protocol provided. With the anticipated advent of a `quantum internet', such protocols and ideas may soon have utility and execution in the real world.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=56><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Lattice-Based Quantum Advantage from Rotated Measurements</div><div class=paper-authors>Yusuf Alnawakhtha (University of Maryland--College Park);

Typically, a protocol has the quantum server prepare a superposition of two-bit strings of a claw and then measure it using Pauli-X or Z measurements. In this paper, we demonstrate a new technique that uses the entire range of qubit measurements from the XY-plane. We show the advantage of this approach in two applications. First, building on (Brakerski et al. 2018, Kalai et al. 2022), we show an optimized two-round proof of quantumness whose security can be expressed directly in terms of the hardness of the LWE (learning with errors) problem. Second, we construct a one-round protocol for blind remote preparation of an arbitrary state on the XY-plane up to a Pauli-Z correction.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=61><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Robustness of implemented device-independent protocols and device-dependent QKD against constrained leakage</div><div class=paper-authors>Ernest Y.-Z.

However, existing security proofs for those demonstrations rely on a typical assumption in DI cryptography, that the devices do not leak any unwanted information to each other or to an adversary. This assumption may be difficult to perfectly enforce in practice. While there exist other DI security proofs that account for a constrained amount of such leakage, the techniques used are somewhat unsuited for analyzing the recent DI protocol demonstrations. In this work, we address this issue by studying a constrained leakage model suited for this purpose, which should also be relevant for future similar experiments. Our proof structure is compatible with recent proof techniques for flexibly analyzing a wide range of DI protocol implementations. With our approach, we compute some estimates of the effects of leakage on the keyrates of those protocols, hence providing a clearer understanding of the amount of leakage that can be allowed while still obtaining positive keyrates. Our results and techniques should also be relevant in proving security of device-dependent QKD against constrained leakage.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=67><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Device-independent uncloneable encryption</div><div class=paper-authors>Srijita Kundu (University of Waterloo);

In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme. Moreover, we show our variant of uncloneable encryption works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money, and can be used to get uncloneable bits without using the quantum random oracle model. Finally, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry. In particular, the resulting single-decryptor encryption scheme achieves device-independent security with respect to a standard definition of security against random plaintexts.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=72><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Efficient polar encoding for information reconciliation in QKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Snehasis Addy (University of Calgary);

More precisely, we consider a quantum communication architecture where the qubit generation and measurement happen at the two ends of the line, whilst intermediate parties are limited to single-qubit unitary transforms. This network topology has been previously introduced to implement quantum-assisted secret-sharing protocols for classical data, as well as the key establishment, and secure computing.
This architecture has numerous advantages. The intermediate nodes are only using simplified hardware, which makes them easier to implement. Moreover, key establishment between arbitrary pairs of parties in the network does not require key routing through intermediate nodes. This is in contrast with quantum key distribution networks for which non-
adjacent nodes need intermediate ones to route keys, thereby revealing these keys to intermediate parties and consuming previously established ones to secure the routing process.
Our main result is to show the security of key establishment on quantum line networks. We show the security using the framework of abstract cryptography. This immediately makes the security composable, showing that the keys can be used for encryption or other tasks.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=111><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Practical High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution Protocol over deployed Multicore fiber</div><div class=paper-authors>Mujtaba Zahidy (Technical University of Denmark);

We build a realistic noise model that takes environmental photons, dark counts, channel losses and non-unit detection efficiency into account and show that our new protocol allows secure key rates for twice as many environmental photons than comparable protocols available in literature.

Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate witness, known as a Bell inequality, difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, however achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which are often incompatible with optimal randomness generation. As a result we find a trade-off between maximum randomness and Bell violation. Understanding this trade-off for more than two parties has not been explored, and would inform the best way to generate DI randomness in this setting. Moreover, suitable techniques that enable maximum randomness certification for arbitrarily many parties are missing. Here, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations exhibiting a violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. We find that maximum quantum violation and maximum randomness are incompatible for any even number of parties, with incompatibility diminishing as the number of parties grow, and conjecture the precise trade-off. We also show that maximum MABK violation is not necessary for maximum randomness for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a new technique for randomness certification, which we call "expanding Bell inequalities". Our technique allows one to take a bipartite Bell expression, known as the seed, and transform it into a multipartite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=124><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>An optical ground station in Singapore for satellite-to-ground quantum communication</div><div class=paper-authors>Ayesha Reezwana (CQT, National University of Singapore);

Future transactions will likely be secured by quantum means such as point-to-point quantum key distribution and more complex quantum protocols. Quantum key distribution has the potential to revolutionize secure communication, but it is often limited by device imperfections and environmental factors such as weather conditions. Currently, quantum key distribution schemes based on orbital angular momentum-carrying optical beams employ conventional settings. As a result, various attacks, such as detector side-channel attacks, are possible, and these beams are subject to spatial aberrations because of atmospheric turbulence and poor weather conditions. As a result, we present a novel approach to measurement device-independent quantum key distribution scheme using vortex vector modes and scalar beams that is capable of achieving high key rates even under diverse weather conditions, including clear skies, light rain, and fog. Furthermore, adopting this approach maximizes the advantages of both orbital angular momentum states and measurement device-independent quantum key distribution. According to our implementation, a secure key can be transmitted up to a maximum distance of approximately 178 kilometers under clear conditions, and we can transmit signals up to a comparable distance of approximately 160 kilometers under adverse weather conditions. Since these distances are comparable, this work presents a significant advance, illustrating how measurement device-independent quantum key distribution can be implemented using vortex vector modes. Most significantly, results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, opening up new possibilities for secure long-distance communication under adverse weather conditions.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=133><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Implementation of a multiplexed quantum key distribution system simulator with a detailed secure key generation model</div><div class=paper-authors>Masashi Ito (Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation);

To realize high-speed, real-time communication of large-volume data using one-time pad cryptography with QKD modules, it will be important to multiplex QKD modules in the future. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the physical size of the device for the practical application of multiplexed QKD modules.
In this study, we focused on miniaturizing the key distillation process required at the back end of the QKD chip. To reduce the size of the device, it is necessary to estimate as accurately as possible the minimum computing power required to run the key distillation process for the target secret key rate (SKR). However, the performance of the key distillation process requires computing power and involves the exchange of messages via classical channels.
Therefore, we evaluate the performance by a network simulator before performing evaluations on the actual equipment.
In this paper, we focus on the behavior of classical communication paths in the multiplexed QKD system, which is a problem in studying the key distillation process, and we evaluate it with the simulator. Specifically, we clarify the relationship between the required performance of the key distillation process (i.e., throughput) and the target SKR, which is necessary to realize a part of the key distillation process in hardware.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=135><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>A Simple and Self-Testing Quantum Random Number Generator</div><div class=paper-authors>Fadri Grünenfelder (University of Vigo);

While the original study considers the noiseless setting, many subsequent studies extended this result to more general settings. However, all of them focused only on the communication speed in various noisy settings. While dense coding with the noiseless setting realizes twice communication speed, it also realizes quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) as follows.In dense coding, the sender, Alice, and the receiver, Bob, share perfect Bell states and Alice encodes her message by application of a unitary operation. Since Alice's local state is a completely mixed state, the eavesdropper, Eve, cannot obtain any information about the message even when Eve intercepts the transmitted quantum state. However, it is not easy to share a perfect Bell state. Hence, we need to consider secure communication under imperfect shared state. Specifically, we study secure direct communication by using a general preshared quantum state and a generalization of dense coding. In this scenario, Alice is allowed to apply a unitary operation on the preshared state to encode her message, and the set of allowed unitary operations forms a group. To decode the message, Bob is allowed to apply a measurement across his own system and the system he receives. In the worst scenario, we guarantee that Eve obtains no information for the message even when Eve access the joint system between the system that she intercepts and her original system of the preshared state.
For a practical application, we construct a modular wiretap code by concatenating inverse universal hashing and an arbitrary error correcting code. Combining the wiretap code with error verification, we propose a concrete protocol for the private dense coding model and derive an upper bound of information leakage in the finite-length setting. We also discuss how to apply our scenario to the case with discrete Weyl-Heisenberg representation when the preshared state is unknown. In this case, Pauli encoding operation and Pauli channel are considered. Hence, our protocol can be applied many similar tasks.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=150><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>An efficient method for certifying quantum properties with non-i.i.d. spot-checking trials</div><div class=paper-authors>Yanbao Zhang (Oak Ridge National Lab);

When performing an information task with an unreliable quantum resource, it is incorrect to treat the random variables associated with repeated experimental trials as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). To certify the performance of such a task, one can make a random decision in each trial, either to spot-check some property of the quantum resource or to utilize the resource for the task. The task considered can be quantum key distribution, quantum randomness expansion, verifiable quantum computation, or resource allocation in quantum networks. Unfortunately, existing methods for certifying quantum performance through spot-checking are not suitable for non-i.i.d. repeated trials without additional assumptions. Here we present a novel method to address this challenge. The method works efficiently with a finite number of non-i.i.d. trials. Furthermore, our method can be adapted to estimate quantum properties in situations where the quantum resource is spot-checked and destroyed by a measurement during each non-i.i.d. repeated trial.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=152><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>FPGA-Based LED Source with Indistinguishable States for Decoy State QKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Daniel Sanchez Rosales (The Ohio State University);

Here we present an FPGA-controlled prepare-and-measure BB84 polarization-based decoy state protocol using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Our setup uses three separate LEDs driven by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that go through different optical paths that set the state of polarization. Each LED is connected to two GPIO pins via a different resistive path. By setting one pin to high impedance and driving the other with a nanosecond-scale electrical signal, we can choose between signal and decoy states. We can thus send 3 signal states, 3 decoy states, and 3 vacuum states. To prevent side-channel attacks multi-source QKD systems require that each state is indistinguishable from the others in the spatial, spectral, and temporal degrees-of-freedom on the photon. We do this by passing the 3 photonic wavepackets through the same single-mode fiber and 1-nm-bandwith spectral filter and use dynamic shifting of the FPGA phase-locked-loops to control the phase and the width of the electrical pulses that drive the LEDs, which allows us to control the optical pulses produced by the LEDs. Both spectral and temporal profiles are shown in Figure 1. We control the timing of the photonic wavepackets to a resolution of 78 ps. Additionally, we use the FPGA to generate true random states as required by the BB84 protocol. To quantify the indistinguishability of Alice’s various states, we use the mutual information to calculate the fraction of the final sifted key that an eavesdropper would know after making temporal and/or spectral measurements on every state that is sent. We are able to achieve 2.39e-05 and 4.31e-05 mutual information fraction leaked in the spectral and temporal waveforms, respectively. Furthermore we put our scheme into practice with a simple tabletop QKD setup where we are able to achieve 1.7% quantum bit-error rate (QBER) in the L/R bases and 2.1% QBER in the H/V bases. Additionally, our system's SWaP restrictions make it very desirable for highly mobile platforms such as drones.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=154><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Qubit-based clock synchronization using a Bayesian approach Applied to Drone-Based QKD Systems</div><div class=paper-authors>Roderick D.

Qubit-based synchronization protocols directly use the transmitted quantum states and thus avoid the need for additional classical synchronization hardware, but previous approaches sacrifice secure key either directly or indirectly. Here, we introduce a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm that incorporates all published information to efficiently find the clock offset without sacrificing any secure key [1]. Additionally, the output of the algorithm is a probability, which allows us to quantify our confidence in the synchronization.
Our experimental system employs an efficient three-state BB84 prepare-and-measure protocol with decoy states. Our algorithm exploits the correlations between Alice’s published basis and mean photon number choices (which must already be published for the protocol) and Bob’s measurement outcomes to probabilistically determine the most likely clock offset. We perform cross-correlations using Fast Fourier Transforms to count the number of each type of event pairing for each potential offset (e.g., how many times Alice sent a decoy state in the horizontal/vertical polarization basis and Bob registered a click in the horizontal detector). Taking these along with a lookup table for the probabilities of the different event pairings, we determine the synchronization probability of the different potential offsets using Bayesian analysis.
To demonstrate the robust nature of this algorithm, we tracked its performance using simulated data with varying parameters. We find that we can achieve a 95% synchronization confidence using a string length of only 4,140 communication bin widths, meaning we can tolerate clock drift approaching 1 part in 4,140 in this example when simulating this system with a dark count probability per communication bin width of 8⨉10-4 and a received mean photon number of 0.01. The relationship between the received mean photon number and the number of communication bin widths required to achieve a 95% synchronization confidence is shown in Fig. 1.
We applied this algorithm to data collected from our drone-to-done QKD experiments, with a received mean photon number of 0.043, achieving quantum bit error rates of 0.0106, 0.0287, and 0.0361 for our 3 states.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=156><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Analysis of a High-dimensional Restricted Quantum Key Distribution Protocol</div><div class=paper-authors>Hasan Iqbal (University of Connecticut);

We identify and address some limitations of the postselection technique as applied to optical prepare-and-measure QKD protocols. We extend this analysis to decoy-state protocols, which are essential for long-distance QKD. Finally, we also improve the practical applicability of the postselection technique.

photon source. While this assumption poses no significant issues when the channel loss is
low, high loss can have a detrimental impact on the system's performance. To overcome
high loss, the most intuitive solution is to increase the gain of entangled photon pairs by
sending a large quantity of them. However, high-gain sources tend to degrade the
quantum quality of entangled photon pair sources. We derived the density matrix of the
quantum state in the distribution of polarization-entangled photon pairs under the non-
symmetric channel losses with threshold detectors. We analyzed the variation of the CHSH
inequality parameter S and the effective photon state transfer probability 𝑁𝑚 by changing
the non-linear gain γ. The increase and subsequent decrease in Nm with increasing γ can
be interpreted as follows: when γ is small, the state is not properly transmitted due to high
loss, but as γ increases, the error probability, such as double-click events, increases due to
the influence of multi-photon events, leading to a decrease in Nm. This result indicates the
need to optimize the brightness of the light source for practical implementation in
quantum information technologies. This study is expected to contribute to the analysis of
discrete variable quantum key distribution(DVQKD) systems like BBM92, E91, and long-

The first one is related with the application of quantum entanglement to producing several mutually coupled in a random manner bit sequences, which can be used in cryptographic applications and verified in a parallel manner allowing for entropy measurement in real time in public domain using arbitrary large resources for patterns detection, but without compromising the secrecy of coupled by quantum entanglement dual random binary sequences. This is a new concept for verification of fidelity of random bit sequences in a fully non-destructive way, allowing for various applications of generated random bits for which secrecy is important (e.g. in cryptograhic applications). The idea is the development of former our proposal [1]. The second concept is reletad to our progress in prototyping of miniaturized QRNG utilizing the quantum transitions allong the Fermi golden rule as the entropy source, developed for application to quantum cryptography (QKD) systems based on continuous variables. The prototype exploiting, as the source of the entropy, the photoelectric process in a photodiode coupled to a small LED is miniaturized to size of 2 cm [2] and produces the random sequence with a rate of 1 Mb/s. We present current developments of the concept towards its further miniaturization to sizes suitable for using this QRNG device in portable computers, mobile phones and miniaturized terminals for QKD using non-entangled photons.

Most QKD research focuses on "device-dependent" protocols whose security is conditioned on their quantum devices operating within specified tolerances. These assumptions on device operation render device-dependent protocols vulnerable to attacks that exploit the differences in real devices and their models in security proofs, and hence threaten the security of such protocols. Alternatively, Device-independent (DI) QKD seeks to achieve security with minimal assumptions on quantum devices by relying on quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities, overcoming this short-coming of device-dependent QKD.
Our work is motivated by the following two observations. First, DIQKD is more secure but has worse noise and loss tolerances than device-dependent QKD. This point has motivated investigations into new techniques to improve these tolerance thresholds such as random key generation, random post-selection, noisy pre-processing and advantage distillation, the last of which we investigate, and which describes a two-way communication procedure in the error correction step of the protocol. Second, the precise circumstances in which DIQKD is possible are unclear, since not all correlations that violate Bell inequalities can be used to distill a secret key in DIQKD. Under the independent and identically distributed (IID) collective attacks framework, previous work sought to resolve both problems by implementing DIQKD with an advantage distillation protocol called the repetition-code protocol. The authors derived both a sufficient and a conjectured necessary condition for security based on the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, the significance of their results was limited by a gap between the two security conditions, which prevented the calculation of tight noise tolerance bounds and suggested that the fidelity is not the right quantity to consider to characterize exactly when key distillation in DIQKD is possible.
Furthermore, in our work we replace the fidelity in the security proofs with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a measure of distinguishability in symmetric hypothesis testing, and achieve equivalent sufficient and necessary conditions for security for the repetition-code DIQKD protocol under the i.i.d collective attacks framework. Consequently, our work strongly indicates that quantum Chernoff divergence is the relevant quantity to describe the security of the repetition-code DIQKD protocol. With our new security condition, we show that the noise tolerance thresholds of the repetition-code DIQKD protocol outperform even one-way DIQKD protocols implemented with noisy pre-processing and random key measurements.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=174><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Quantum key distribution with multiple photon number distributions</div><div class=paper-authors>Roberto G.

However, the loss tolerance of SPS-based QKD is compromised by photon number splitting (PNS) attacks against non-negligible multiphoton emissions. Decoy state (DS) techniques mitigate against PNS attacks, with WCP-DS QKD over several hundred km in fibre being demonstrated. Here, we adapt the DS method to any practical SPS that can easily generate multiple photon number distributions (PND) by attenuating its original photon emissions. Hence, we provide finite-key security bounds for a Multi-PND (adapted 2-Decoy) protocol using Efficient BB84 with optimised parameters. We use a particular true quantum dot source to compare its key rate generation with a Single-PND (adapted Non-Decoy) protocol for several finite block sizes. As expected, the Multi-PND gives higher key rates than the Single-PND, except for considerably small blocks. Moreover, the Multi-PND protocol goes beyond 200 km of tolerable fibre distance for high acquisition times. In this work, we set a generalised method to employ the DS techniques with any realistic SPS and further research may be done implementing distinct SPS characteristics.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=176><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Time-bin Entanglement Swapping</div><div class=paper-authors>Samantha I.
