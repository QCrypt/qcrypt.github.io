However, secure key rate of point-point quantum key distribution (QKD) is bounded by the linear rate-loss limit. Twin-field (TF) QKD can break this limit but its implementation requires global phase tracking and usually also cumbersome interferometric implementations, which are often impractical for network deployment. We remove the above shortcomings with two different solutions. In the first solution, we introduce locally generated frequency combs to stabilise an open channel, and develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Free-space Photonic Quantum Memory for Networking''</title><link>/sessions/invited_arnold/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_arnold/</guid><description>Abstract: Photonic quantum memories will play an essential role in many quantum information protocols, particularly for the synchronization of repeater nodes. Most photonic memories operate by storing the photon in matter-based systems, but those approaches have limitations, e.g., they are inherently narrow bandwidth and for only particular wavelengths, often require costly cryogenic overhead, and typically have low retrieval efficiency into single-mode fiber. In this work, we develop a free-space room-temperature photonic quantum memory, allowing us to avoid the aforementioned drawbacks.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''From the Hardness of Detecting Superpositions to Cryptography: Quantum Public Key Encryption and Commitments ''</title><link>/sessions/invited_hhan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_hhan/</guid><description>Abstract: Recently, Aaronson, Atia, and Susskind (arXiv:2009.07450) showed that detecting interference between two orthogonal states is as hard as swapping these states. While their original motivation was from quantum gravity, we show its applications in quantum cryptography: The first public-key encryption scheme from cryptographic non-abelian group actions, and a simple and efficient compiler between the computational-hiding statistical-binding and the statistical-hiding computational-binding commitment.

However, in order to widely deploy such systems in real-world telecommunications networks, a few more obstacles have to be surpassed. A couple of these were tackled in our group via the usage of the 3-state BB84 time-bin protocol with 1-decoy state. One challenge involves increasing the rate of secret key production. We will discuss how we managed to achieve one of the highest secret key rates by using a multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, as well as high-speed electronics and fast post-processing.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Long Distance Quantum Key Distribution Gets Simpler''</title><link>/sessions/invited_lai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_lai/</guid><description>Abstract: Quantum cryptography promises secure communication between two distant users.

In the language of Impagliazzo&amp;rsquo;s five worlds, this is a construction of pseudorandom states in &amp;ldquo;Algorithmica,&amp;rdquo; and hence shows that in a black-box setting, quantum cryptography based on pseudorandom states is possible even if one-way functions do not exist. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there exists a property of a cryptographic hash function that simultaneously (1) suffices to construct pseudorandom quantum states, (2) holds for a random oracle, and thus plausibly holds for existing hash functions like SHA3, and (3) is independent of the P vs.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: ''Satellite-Based Quantum Key Distribution Network''</title><link>/sessions/invited_liao/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_liao/</guid><description>Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can share random bits between two separated parties called Alice and Bob; Alice uses the bits to encrypt a message with a one-time-pad way and deliver it to Bob in a public channel; Bob decrypts it to get the original message; quantum mechanics and Shannon information theory guarantee the security. Since the first protocol was proposed in 1984, many experiments have been demonstrated in both fiber and free space channels with key rates and distances growing up.</description></item><item><title>Invited Talk: Constructive Post-Quantum Reductions</title><link>/sessions/invited_kalai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/invited_kalai/</guid><description>Abstract: In this talk I will discuss when we can &amp;ldquo;lift&amp;rdquo; classical reductions to post-quantum ones in a constructive manner. It is customary to argue that while this is problematic in the interactive setting, non-interactive reductions immediately carry over to the post-quantum setting. In this talk I will focus on the non-interactive setting and describe technical issues that arise, related to quantum auxiliary inputs. I will show how (and when) we can overcome these issues, and successfully lift a reduction to the post-quantum setting in a constructive manner.</description></item><item><title>IQC, University of Waterloo</title><link>/partners/gold/iqc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/gold/iqc/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ivan Damgård</title><link>/team/advisory/ivan_damgard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/advisory/ivan_damgard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jian-Wei Pan</title><link>/team/advisory/jian-wei_pan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/advisory/jian-wei_pan/</guid><description/></item><item><title>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</title><link>/partners/gold/jpmchase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/gold/jpmchase/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kai-Min Chung</title><link>/team/steering/kaimin_chung/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/steering/kaimin_chung/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lijun Ma</title><link>/team/org/lijun_ma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/org/lijun_ma/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Marco Lucamarini</title><link>/team/steering/marco_lucamarini/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/steering/marco_lucamarini/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Maria Herd</title><link>/team/org/maria/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/org/maria/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Michele Mosca</title><link>/team/advisory/michele_mosca/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/advisory/michele_mosca/</guid><description/></item><item><title>News</title><link>/news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/news/</guid><description>News December 12 – Talk Videos on YouTubeTalks from QCrypt 2023 are now available to watch on YouTube.

This tutorial will focus on the notion of everlasting security, which considers the following experiment. Initially, a computationally-bounded adversary receives a computationally-hiding commitment to some plaintext. Later, they issue a (classical) certificate attesting that they destroyed the underlying plaintext information via an irreversible measurement. If the certificate is found to be valid, it is guaranteed that the plaintext is now information-theoretically removed from the adversary’s view.</description></item><item><title>Tutorial Talk: ''Pseudorandom Quantum States''</title><link>/sessions/tutorial_yuen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/tutorial_yuen/</guid><description>Abstract: I will give a tutorial on the rapidly developing topic of quantum pseudorandomness, in particular pseudorandom quantum states. These are states that are efficiently generatable, but cannot be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random states. I will discuss their motivation, constructions, and applications to cryptography and beyond.

There are two main issues in practice &amp;mdash; implementation security and system performance. The proposal of the measurement-device-independent scheme primarily enhances the former. The latter is characterized by the dependence of the key rate on the channel transmittance, R(η). In this tutorial, I shall review the security proofs of various measurement-device-independent schemes. I shall emphasize the recent developments, such as twin-field and mode-pairing schemes, that achieve the quadratic key-rate improvement.</description></item><item><title>TWCA</title><link>/partners/bronze/twca/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/bronze/twca/</guid><description/></item><item><title>University of Amsterdam</title><link>/partners/community/uva/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/partners/community/uva/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Updates &amp; Announcements</title><link>/sessions/__updatesannouncements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions/__updatesannouncements/</guid><description>virtual Meet &amp;amp; Greet Room .
