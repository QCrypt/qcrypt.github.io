On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/OXeArwqBNQI target=_blank>[YouTube,

With its security being protected by principles of quantum mechanics, some technology challenges remain towards the practical application of QKD. The major one is the distance limit, which is caused by the fact that a quantum signal cannot be amplified while the channel loss is exponential with the distance for photon transmission in optical fiber. Here using the 3-intensity sending-or-not-sending protocol with the actively-odd-parity-pairing method, we demonstrate a fiber-based twin-field QKD over 1002 km. In our experiment, we developed a dual-band phase estimation and ultra-low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to suppress the system noise to around 0.02 Hz. The secure key rate is $9.53\times10^{-12}$ per pulse through 1002 km fiber in the asymptotic regime, and $8.75\times10^{-12}$ per pulse at 952 km considering the finite size effect. Our work constitutes a critical step toward the future large-scale quantum network.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/QmxAnPnWTho target=_blank>[YouTube,

It requires, however, that the phase of each emitted pulse is uniformly random. This might be difficult to guarantee in practice, due to inevitable device imperfections and/or the use of an external phase modulator for phase randomization, which limits the possible selected phases to a finite set. Here, we investigate the security of decoy-state QKD with arbitrary, continuous or discrete, non-uniform phase randomization, and show that this technique is quite robust to deviations from the ideal uniformly random scenario. For this, we combine a novel parameter estimation technique based on semi-definite programming, with the use of basis mismatched events, to tightly estimate the parameters that determine the achievable secret key rate. In doing so, we demonstrate that our analysis can significantly outperform previous results that address more restricted scenarios.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/euwPWxjARVw target=_blank>[YouTube,

Weak coin flipping (WCF) is a significant such primitive which allows two mistrustful parties to agree on a random bit while they favor opposite outcomes. Remarkably, perfect information-theoretic security can be achieved in principle for quantum WCF, which is impossible for a classical coin flip without computational assumptions or trusting a third party. In this work, we overcome conceptual and practical issues that have prevented the experimental demonstration of this primitive to date, and demonstrate how quantum resources can provide cheat sensitivity, whereby each party can detect a cheating opponent, and an honest party is never sanctioned. Such a property is not known to be classically achievable with information-theoretic security. Our experiment implements a refined, loss-tolerant version of a recently proposed theoretical protocol and exploits heralded single photons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a carefully optimized linear optical interferometer including beam splitters with variable reflectivities and a fast optical switch for the verification step. High values of our protocol benchmarks are maintained for attenuation corresponding to several kilometers of telecom optical fiber.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href="https://youtu.be/9sy6-lAHEW0?start=1284" target=_blank>[YouTube,

Emerging progress in quantum technologies involving such links needs to be accompanied by appropriate certification tools. In adversarial scenarios, a certification method can be vulnerable to attacks if too much trust is placed on the underlying system. Here, we propose a protocol in a device independent framework, which allows for the certification of practical quantum transmission links in scenarios where minimal assumptions are made about the functioning of the certification setup. We take in particular unavoidable transmission losses into account by modeling the link as a completely-positive trace-decreasing map. We also crucially remove the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples, which is known to be incompatible with adversarial settings. Finally, in view of the use of the certified transmitted states for follow-up applications, our protocol allows to estimate the quality of the state and does not certify the channel only. To illustrate the practical relevance and the feasibility of our protocol with currently available technology we provide an experimental implementation based on a state-of-the-art polarization entangled photon pair source in a Sagnac configuration and analyse its robustness for realistic losses and errors.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/9sy6-lAHEW0 target=_blank>[YouTube,

Unlike demonstrations in fiber of fixed point-to-point, QKD between mobile platforms provides unique challenges such as designing systems with reduced size, weight, and power, establishing a stable line-of-sight as the platforms are in motion, and maintaining performance over a wide operating temperature range, etc. We design our QKD transmitter and receiver using a modular design that is platform-agnostic. This allows us to deploy the same QKD system on an octocopter drone and a car without any hardware or software modifications. We describe critical subsystems including our resonant-cavity QKD source, custom prepare and measure optics, pointing, acquisition, and tracking system, single-photon detector, field-programmable gate array-based time-tagger, and qubit-based time-synchronization algorithm.

The most commonly known setup is the so-called non-local one, in which two devices that cannot communicate with each other present a violation of a Bell inequality. In recent years, a new variant of DI protocols, requiring only a single device, arose. In this novel research avenue, the no-communication assumption is replaced with a computational assumption which states that the device cannot solve certain post-quantum cryptographic tasks. The protocols in literature that have been analyzed in this setting, e.g., randomness certification, used ad hoc proof techniques. In addition, the strength of the achieved results is hard to judge due to their complexity.
Here, we build on ideas coming from the study of non-local DI protocols and develop a new modular proof technique for the single-device computational setting. We present a flexible framework for proving the security of such protocols by utilizing a combination of tools from quantum information theory, such as the entropic uncertainty relation and the entropy accumulation theorem. This leads to an insightful and simple proof of security as well as to explicit quantitative bounds. Our work thus acts as the basis for the analysis of future protocols for DI randomness generation, expansion, amplification, and key distribution based on post-quantum cryptographic assumptions.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/1Fie3yAPCU0 target=_blank>[YouTube,

In the current work, a fully chip-based decoder for polarization-encoding QKD was proposed. The chip realized a polarization state analyzer and compensated for the BB84 protocol without the requirement of additional hardware, which was based on a polarization-to-path conversion method utilizing a polarization splitter-rotator. The chip was fabricated adopting a standard silicon photonics foundry, which was of a compact design and suitable for mass production. In the experimental stability test, an average quantum bit error rate of 0.59% was achieved through continuous operation for 10 h without any polarization feedback. Furthermore, the chip enabled the automatic compensation of the fiber polarization drift when utilizing the developed feedback algorithm, which was emulated by a random fiber polarization scrambler. Moreover, a finite-key secret rate of 240 bps over a fiber spool of 100 km was achieved in the case of the QKD demonstration.

IV-PoQ is an interactive protocol between a verifier and a quantum prover consisting of two phases. In the first phase, the verifier is probabilistic polynomial-time, and it interacts with the prover. In the second phase, the verifier becomes inefficient, and makes its decision based on the transcript of the first phase. If the prover is honest, the inefficient verifier accepts with high probability, but any classical malicious prover only has a small probability of being accepted by the inefficient verifier. Our construction demonstrates the following results: (1)If one-way functions exist, then IV-PoQ exist. (2)If distributional collision-resistant hash functions exist (which exist if hard-on-average problems in SZK exist), then constant-round IV-PoQ exist. We also demonstrate quantum advantage based on worst-case-hard assumptions.

We show that tests of quantumness that follow a certain template, which captures recent proposals such as (Kalai et al., 2022), can in fact do much more. Namely, the same protocols can be used for certifying a qubit, a building-block that stands at the heart of applications such as certifiable randomness and classical delegation of quantum computation.
Certifying qubits was previously only known to be possible based on the hardness of the Learning with Errors problem and the use of adaptive hardcore (Brakerski et al., 2018). Our framework allows certification of qubits based only on the existence of post-quantum trapdoor claw-free functions, or on quantum fully homomorphic encryption. These can be instantiated, for example, from Ring Learning with Errors.
On the technical side, we show that the quantum soundness of any such protocol can be reduced to proving a bound on a simple algorithmic task: informally, answering "two challenges simultaneously'' in the protocol. Our reduction formalizes the intuition that these protocols demonstrate quantumness by leveraging the impossibility of rewinding a general quantum prover. This allows us to prove tight bounds on the quantum soundness of (Kahanamoku-Meyer et al., 2021) and (Kalai et al., 2022), showing that no quantum polynomial-time prover can succeed with probability larger than cos^2(π/8)≈0.853. Previously, only an upper bound on the success probability of classical provers, and a lower bound on the success probability of quantum provers, were known. We then extend this proof of quantum soundness to show that provers that approach the quantum soundness bound must perform almost anti-commuting measurements. This certifies that the prover holds a qubit.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/_fOTUzIevVA target=_blank>[YouTube,

In sharp contrast, the picture of concurrently secure MPC (or even 2PC), for both classical and quantum functionalities, still remains unclear. Quantum information behaves in a fundamentally different way, making the job of adversary harder and easier at the same time. Thus, it is unclear if the positive or negative results from the classical setting still apply. This work initiates a systematic study of concurrent secure computation in the quantum setting. We obtain a mix of positive and negative results.
We first show that assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions (PQ-OWFs), concurrently secure 2PC (and thus MPC) for quantum functionalities is impossible. Next, we focus on the bounded-concurrent setting, where we obtain simulation-sound zero-knowledge arguments for both NP and QMA, assuming PQ-OWFs. This is obtained by a new design of simulation-sound gadget which is compatible with the quantum rewinding strategy recently developed by Ananth, Chung, and La Placa [CRYPTO'21] for bounded-concurrent post-quantum ZK.
Moreover, we show that our technique is general enough---It also leads to quantum-secure bounded-concurrent coin-flipping protocols, and eventually general-purpose 2PC and MPC, for both classical and quantum functionalities. All these constructions can be based on the quantum hardness of Learning with Errors.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/fLVOlEvMkiQ target=_blank>[YouTube,

The most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at the outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but appears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the m–bit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the n–bit input.
We show that when n − m ∈ ω(lg n), any protocol for WOTRO in the CRQS model can be attacked by an (inefficient) adversary. Moreover, our adversary is efficiently simulatable, which rules out the possibility of proving the computational security of a scheme by a fully black-box reduction to a cryptographic game assumption. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game quantum assumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQ$ model (where the CRQS consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO protocol where m = n, then hash the output.
The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the fully-black-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the impossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC ’13) to the CRQS model. Second, we show a fully-black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of quantum lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt ’19) where quantum bolts have an additional parameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts.

Given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, our obfuscator outputs a quantum state $\ket{\widetilde{Q}}$ that can be used to evaluate $Q$ repeatedly on arbitrary inputs.
Instantiating the VBB obfuscator for classical circuits with any candidate post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator gives us the first candidate construction of indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. In particular, our scheme is the first candidate obfuscator for a class of circuits that is powerful enough to implement Shor's algorithm (SICOMP 1997).
Our approach follows Bartusek and Malavolta (ITCS 2022), who obfuscate \emph{null} quantum circuits by obfuscating the verifier of an appropriate classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) scheme. We go beyond null circuits by constructing a publicly-verifiable CVQC scheme for quantum \emph{partitioning} circuits, which can be used to verify the evaluation procedure of Mahadev's quantum fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (FOCS 2018). We achieve this by upgrading the one-time secure scheme of Bartusek (TCC 2021) to a fully reusable scheme, via a publicly-decodable \emph{Pauli functional commitment}, which we formally define and construct in this work. This commitment scheme, which satisfies a notion of binding against committers that can access the receiver's standard and Hadamard basis decoding functionalities, is constructed by building on techniques of Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC 2020) introduced in the context of equivocal but collision-resistant hash functions.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/kk1ET4U_EI4 target=_blank>[YouTube,

Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a \emph{single} round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted, \emph{off-the-shelf (OTS)} quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input. In the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of the computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic verification device, all in a single round.
We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS model. Scaling up the technique also yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This yields the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover zero-knowledge proof system for QMA.
As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for $n$-EPR pairs using only constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification. Along the way, we also provide an enhanced version of a well-known stability result due to Gowers and Hatami and show how it completes a common argument used in self-testing.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/NjpF5lOewhc target=_blank>[YouTube,

Does there exist minimally-interactive secure multiparty computation that only makes (black-box) use of symmetric-key primitives? We provide affirmative answers to these questions in a model where parties have access to shared EPR pairs, thus demonstrating the cryptographic power of this resource.
- First, we construct a one-shot (i.e., single message) string oblivious transfer (OT) protocol with random receiver bit in the shared EPR pairs model, assuming the (sub-exponential) hardness of LWE.
Building on this, we show that {\em secure teleportation through quantum channels} is possible. Specifically, given the description of any quantum operation $Q$, a sender with (quantum) input $\rho$ can send a single classical message that securely transmits $Q(\rho)$ to a receiver. That is, we realize an ideal quantum channel that takes input $\rho$ from the sender and provably delivers $Q(\rho)$ to the receiver without revealing any other information.
This immediately gives a number of applications in the shared EPR pairs model: (1) non-interactive secure computation of unidirectional \emph{classical} randomized functionalities, (2) NIZK for QMA from standard (sub-exponential) hardness assumptions, and (3) a non-interactive \emph{zero-knowledge} state synthesis protocol.
- Next, we construct a two-round (round-optimal) secure multiparty computation protocol for classical functionalities in the shared EPR pairs model that is \emph{unconditionally-secure} in the (quantum-accessible) random oracle model.
Classically, both of these results cannot be obtained without some form of correlated randomness shared between the parties, and the only known approach is to have a trusted dealer set up random (string) OT correlations. In the quantum world, we show that shared EPR pairs (which are simple and can be deterministically generated) are sufficient. At the heart of our work are novel techniques for making use of entangling operations to generate string OT correlations, and for instantiating the Fiat-Shamir transform using correlation-intractability in the quantum setting.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/zjq47avNKzk target=_blank>[YouTube,

In the past few years, we have witnessed a surge of new unclonable primitives. While prior works have mainly focused on establishing feasibility results, another equally important direction, that of understanding the relationship between different unclonable primitives is still in its nascent stages. Moving forward, we need a more systematic study of unclonable primitives.
To this end, we introduce a new framework called cloning games. This framework captures many fundamental unclonable primitives such as quantum money, copy-protection, unclonable encryption, single-decryptor encryption, and many more. By reasoning about different types of cloning games, we obtain many interesting implications to unclonable cryptography, including the following:
1) We obtain the first construction of information-theoretically secure single-decryptor encryption in the one-time setting.
2) We construct unclonable encryption in the quantum random oracle model based on BB84 states, improving upon the previous work, which used coset states. Our work also provides a simpler security proof for the previous work.
3) We construct copy-protection for single-bit point functions in the quantum random oracle model based on BB84 states, improving upon the previous work, which used coset states, and additionally, providing a simpler proof.
4) We establish a relationship between different challenge distributions of copy-protection schemes and single-decryptor encryption schemes.
5) Finally, we present a new construction of one-time encryption with certified deletion.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/ija2eRo9xqE target=_blank>[YouTube,

theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in settings where error correction and
detection are impossible, and have found applications to several other cryptographic tasks.
Roughly speaking, a non-malleable code for a family of tampering functions guarantees that no
adversary can tamper (using functions from this family) the encoding of a given message into
the encoding of a related distinct message.
We focus on the split-state tampering model, one of the strongest and most well-studied
adversarial tampering models. In this model, a codeword is split into two parts which are stored
in physically distant servers, and the adversary can then independently tamper with each part
using arbitrary functions. Previous works on non-malleable codes in the split-state tampering
model only considered the encoding of classical messages. Furthermore, until the recent work
by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (arXiv 2022), adversaries with quantum capabilities and shared
entanglement had not been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous coding
schemes remain secure in this model.
In this work, we introduce the notion of split-state non-malleable codes for quantum messages
secure against quantum adversaries with shared entanglement. We construct explicit codes in
this model by relying on a recent quantum-secure 2-source non-malleable randomness encoder
by Batra, Boddu, and Jain [BBJ23], arguments from Aggarwal, Boddu and Jain [ABJ22] and
with use of unitary 2-designs.
1) More precisely, we construct the first efficiently encodable and decodable split-state non-
malleable code for quantum messages (while preserving entanglement with external sys-
tems) achieving security against quantum adversaries having shared entanglement with
codeword length n, any message length at most $n^\Omega(1)$, and error $2^{-n^{\Omega(1)}}$.
2) For the case of uniform quantum message, we provide the first constant rate (rate 1/11)
non-malleable code (while preserving entanglement with external systems) achieving code-
word length n and error $2^{-n^{\Omega(1)}}$.

Like standard pseudorandom states (PRS), these are efficiently generated quantum states that are indistinguishable from random, but they can also be measured to create a classical string. This string is
verifiable (given the secret key) and certifies that the state has been destructed. We show that, similarly to PRS, PRSPD can be constructed from any post-quantum one-way function. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first construction of a family of states that satisfies both pseudorandomness and provability of destruction.
We show that many cryptographic applications that were shown based on PRS variants using quantum communication can be based on (variants of) PRSPD using only classical communication.

Quantum random number generation allows for the creation of truly unpredictable numbers thanks to the inherent randomness available in quantum mechanics. A popular approach is using the quantum vacuum state to generate random numbers. While convenient, this approach was generally limited in speed compared to other schemes. Here, through custom co-design of opto-electronic integrated circuits and side-information reduction by digital filtering, we experimentally demonstrated an ultrafast generation rate of 100 Gbit/s, setting a new record for vacuum-based quantum random number generation by one order of magnitude. Furthermore, our experimental demonstrations are well supported by an upgraded device-dependent framework that is secure against both classical and quantum side-information and that also properly considers the non-linearity in the digitization process.

Such a construction is unlikely to exist classically as Cryptomania is believed to be different from Minicrypt.
In particular, by instantiating our construction using Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK), we provide the first round-optimal (2-message) quantum OT protocol secure in the random oracle model, and round-optimal extensions to string and k-out-of-n OT.
At the heart of our construction lies a new method that allows us to prove properties on a received quantum state without revealing additional information on it, even in a non-interactive way and/or with statistical guarantees when using an appropriate classical ZK protocol. We can notably prove that a state has been partially measured (with arbitrary constraints on the set of measured qubits), without revealing any additional information on this set. This notion can be seen as an analog of ZK to quantum states, and we expect it to be of independent interest as it extends complexity theory to quantum languages, as illustrated by the two new complexity classes we introduce, ZKstatesQIP and ZKstatesQMA.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/FKLAodM85jM target=_blank>[YouTube,

commercially available, large-scale deployment of next-generation QKD systems requires photonic and electronic devices that are low-cost, small, and easily integrated with existing network infrastructure. Continuous variable (CV) QKD is a promising option for large-scale deployment due to its compatibility with standard telecom technology. Despite this, the secret key rates of CV-QKD systems have been limited to a few megabits per second due to the bandwidth bottleneck of the receiver and the limited symbol rate of the transmitter. Here, we present the first discrete-modulated coherent state CV-QKD system operating at a classical telecom symbol rate of 10 GBaud. This system generates keys at rates exceeding 0.7 Gb/s over a distance of 5 km and 0.3 Gb/s over a distance of 10 km while being secure against collective attacks in both the asymptotic and finite-size regimes. This is made possible by using a high-speed, co-integrated phase-diverse receiver consisting of a silicon photonics optical front-end and a custom-designed integrated transimpedance amplifier. Additionally, well-engineered digital signal processing is used for quantum state preparation and measurement.

However, the imperfections in realistic devices may lead to potential security risks, which must be accurately characterized and considered in practical security analysis. High-speed optical modulators, being as one of the core components of practical QKD systems, can be used to prepare the required quantum states. Here, we find that optical modulators based on LiNbO3, including phase modulators and intensity modulators, are vulnerable to photorefractive effect caused by external light injection. By changing the power of external light, eavesdroppers can control the intensities of the prepared states, posing a potential threat to the security of QKD. We have experimentally demonstrated the influence of light injection on LiNbO3-based optical modulators and analyzed the security risks caused by the potential green light injection attack, along with the corresponding countermeasures.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=38><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Implementation of a privacy preserving publicly verifiable quantum random number generator</div><div class=paper-authors>Tanvirul Islam (CQT, National University of Singapore);

A trusted device scenario assuming that an adversary has no access to imperfections in the detector is expected to provide significant improvement in the key rate, but such an endeavor so far was made separately for specific protocols and for specific proof techniques.
Here, we develop a simple and general treatment that can incorporate the effects of Gaussian trusted noises for any protocol that uses homodyne/heterodyne measurements.
In our method, a rescaling of the outcome of a noisy homodyne/heterodyne detector renders it equivalent to the outcome of a noiseless detector with a tiny additional loss, thanks to a noise-loss equivalence well-known in quantum optics. Since this method is independent of protocols and security proofs, it is applicable to Gaussian-modulation and discrete-modulation protocols and to any proof techniques developed so far and yet to be discovered as well.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=45><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>On Zero-Knowledge Proofs over the Quantum Internet</div><div class=paper-authors>Mark Carney (Quantum Village Inc.)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a style=color:#4c9cde onclick='return $("#abstract-45").toggle(200),!1'>[Abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-45 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents a new method for quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols.

However, existing security proofs for those demonstrations rely on a typical assumption in DI cryptography, that the devices do not leak any unwanted information to each other or to an adversary. This assumption may be difficult to perfectly enforce in practice. While there exist other DI security proofs that account for a constrained amount of such leakage, the techniques used are somewhat unsuited for analyzing the recent DI protocol demonstrations. In this work, we address this issue by studying a constrained leakage model suited for this purpose, which should also be relevant for future similar experiments. Our proof structure is compatible with recent proof techniques for flexibly analyzing a wide range of DI protocol implementations. With our approach, we compute some estimates of the effects of leakage on the keyrates of those protocols, hence providing a clearer understanding of the amount of leakage that can be allowed while still obtaining positive keyrates.

We construct three new cryptographic primitives whose security is based on uncloneability, and that have in common that their security can be established via a novel monogamy-of-entanglement (MoE) property:
-- We define interactive uncloneable encryption, a version of the uncloneable encryption defined by Broadbent and Lord [TQC 2020] where the receiver must partake in an interaction with the sender in order to decrypt the ciphertext. We provide a one-round construction that is secure in the information-theoretic setting, in the sense that no other receiver may learn the message even if she eavesdrops on all the interactions.
-- We provide a way to make a bit string commitment scheme uncloneable. The scheme is augmented with a check step chronologically in between the commit and open steps, where an honest sender verifies that the commitment may not be opened by an eavesdropper, even if the receiver is malicious. Our construction preserves the assumptions of the original commitment while requiring only a polynomial decrease in the length of the committed string.
-- We construct a receiver-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme, which strengthens the notion of one-sided device independent QKD of Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski, and Wehner (TFKW) [NJP 2013] by also permitting the receiver's classical device to be untrusted. Explicitly, the sender remains fully trusted while only the receiver's communication is trusted. We provide a construction that achieves the same asymptotic error tolerance as the scheme of TFKW.
To show security, we prove an extension of the MoE property of coset states introduced by Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry [Crypto 2021]. In our stronger version, the player Charlie also receives Bob's answer prior to making his guess, thus simulating a party who eavesdrops on an interaction. To make use of this property, we express it as a new type of entropic uncertainty relation which arises naturally from the structure of the underlying MoE game.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=67><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Device-independent uncloneable encryption</div><div class=paper-authors>Srijita Kundu (University of Waterloo);

In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme. Moreover, we show our variant of uncloneable encryption works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money, and can be used to get uncloneable bits without using the quantum random oracle model. Finally, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry.

This network topology has been previously introduced to implement quantum-assisted secret-sharing protocols for classical data, as well as the key establishment, and secure computing.
This architecture has numerous advantages. The intermediate nodes are only using simplified hardware, which makes them easier to implement. Moreover, key establishment between arbitrary pairs of parties in the network does not require key routing through intermediate nodes. This is in contrast with quantum key distribution networks for which non-
adjacent nodes need intermediate ones to route keys, thereby revealing these keys to intermediate parties and consuming previously established ones to secure the routing process.
Our main result is to show the security of key establishment on quantum line networks. We show the security using the framework of abstract cryptography.

We introduce and formalize the notion of post-quantum interactive oracle arguments for languages in QMA, a generalization of interactive oracle proofs (Ben-Sasson--Chiesa--Spooner). We then show how to compile any non-adaptive public-coin interactive oracle argument (with private setup) into a succinct argument (with setup) in the QROM.
To conditionally answer our motivating question via this framework under the post-quantum hardness assumption of LWE, we show that the XZ local Hamiltonian problem with at least inverse-polylogarithmic relative promise gap has an interactive oracle argument with instance-independent setup, which we can then compile.

Continuous variable (CV) QKD based on coherent states and coherent detection is a suitable scheme for integration into existing telecom networks. However, thus far, long-distance CV-QKD has only been demonstrated using a highly complex transmitted local oscillator scheme, opening security loopholes for eavesdroppers and limiting its potential applications. Here, we report a long-distance CV-QKD experiment with a locally generated local oscillator over a 100 km fiber channel. This record-breaking distance is enabled by controlling the phase-noise component of excess noise, using a machine-learning framework for carrier recovery and optimizing the modulation variance. We consider the full CV-QKD protocol implementation and demonstrate the generation of keys secure against collective attacks in asymptotic and finite-size regimes. Our results set an essential milestone for CV quantum access networks realization, where a high loss budget is required, and pave the way for large-scale deployment of secure QK.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=114><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Unifying Quantum Verification and Error-Detection: Theory and Tools for Optimisations</div><div class=paper-authors>Theodoros Kapourniotis (University of Warwick);

To this end, we establish a fundamental correspondence between error-detection and verification and provide sufficient conditions to both achieve security in the Abstract Cryptography framework and optimise resource overheads of all known VBQC-based protocols.

In this paper, we introduce a protocol that lifts classical SMPC to quantum SMPC in a composably and statistically secure way, even for a single honest party.
Unlike previous quantum SMPC protocols, our proposal only requires very limited quantum resources from all but one party; it suffices that the weak parties, i.e. the clients, are able to prepare single-qubit states in the X-Y plane.
The novel quantum SMPC protocol is constructed in a naturally modular way, and relies on a new technique for quantum verification that is of independent interest. This verification technique requires the remote preparation of states only in a single plane of the Bloch sphere.
In the course of proving the security of the new verification protocol, we also uncover a fundamental invariance that is inherent to measurement-based quantum computing.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=116><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Quantum Error Correction (QEC)-Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocols: Technical Considerations, Efficiency and Feasibility.</div><div class=paper-authors>Aida García-Callejo (Spanish National Research Council (CSIC));

Specifically, the possibility of enhancing the security and reliability of QKD systems by adding a secondary layer of quantum coding to the states emitted by Alice in the \textit{Prepare-and-Measure} protocols is exhaustively quantified. Such an encoding scheme would be expected to be achievable by means of quantum hardware potentially available in the mid-term. This last statement refers to the assumed reasonable interconnectivity and scalability requirements that may be imposed on the physical encoding capabilities of a quantum processor for the case here considered, since only 1-qubit states are used in QKD.
The model for quantum states transmission here considered does not impose any restrictions on the quantum channel, but does assume that the noise and errors to which qubits may be subject in QKD links can be characterized by discrete transformations. That is, depending on the physical encoding scheme chosen for photon's polarization, errors such as bit-flip or phase-shift errors (among others) can be corrected through logical gates derived from Pauli operators, which, along with identity, form the basis $\{I,X,Y,Z\}$ for 1-qubit discrete error operators of the form:
\begin{equation}
E = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha_0 & \alpha_1\\
\alpha_2 & \alpha_3
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
\medskip
Such a consideration imposes the need to be able to identify and correct up to a total of $k = 1 + 3n$ different types of errors (including no error at all, bit-flip, phase-shift, and combinations of the previous) that may affect a QKD state (encoded in an $n-$qubit physical state). In line with previous scalability arguments, that requires for the number of physical qubits needed to achieve such encoding to be lower bounded by the product of the previous magnitude and the dimension of the quantum code $C$ used (which, in the context of QKD, shall be $\mathrm{dim}(C) = 2$). Therefore, if $m=1$ is the number of qubits to be encoded for each transmitted state in QKD, the condition:
\begin{equation}
2^n \geq dim(C)(1+3n)
\end{equation}
imposes a a minimum of $n=5$ physical qubits in a quantum algorithm to carry out encoding and correction of a 1-qubit quantum state. However, it should be noted that, beyond the anticipated error types, the efficiency of identifying errors in a key distilled through QKD (i.e., for all purposes, the correctable QBER associated with each transmission) will be all the more efficient the greater the number n of physical qubits available in a processor for such encoding (of the order of $2^{n-1}$). Thus, the minimum requirements of the quantum hardware topology for the feasibility of this type of encoding are specified, as well as the optimal trade-off in terms of the assumable QBER against different types of attacks, supported by future advances in quantum processor scalability. In this sense, beyond the security considerations associated with QKD implementations of this nature, the goal of this analysis is to parallelly discern the potential speed-up of employing quantum algorithms to carry out error correction of QKD keys and their potential superiority over classical error correction processes in the future.
In this regard, two types of QECC are tested in this work. On the one hand, the widespread use of low-density parity check (LDPC)-type linear codes (being linearity a requirement that quantum error correction codes must necessarily satisfy) naturally leads to considering their use in Quantum CSS (Calderbank, Shor \& Steane) codes. The efficiency and performance benefits of LDPC codes applied to QKD are therefore as well transferable to a quantum processor in this context. The performance of these codes applied in QKD is contrasted, secondly, with stabilizer codes. It can be anticipated that the latter may present challenges in the initial algorithm for the encoding of the states emitted by Alice, however the decoding circuit algorithms can be implemented with relative simplicity -albeit scalability limitations- through 1-qubit logical gates (such is also the case with CSS codes once the parity matrix of the LDPC code is known, whose speed advantages over the classical use of belief-propagation algorithms are showed here).
On the previous precepts, this study focuses on carrying out a comparative analysis of the convenience of potentially benefitting from the performance of either type of code, while analyzing technical considerations derived from the experimental implementation of QECC protocols in this QKD hybrid approach. The most important considerations are the following:
-Complexity. From the point of view of reliability of these types of implementations, potential disadvantages are analyzed in terms of complexity added to real physical systems. Not only is the experimental complexity increase of combining quantum hardware with QKD optical transmissions estimated, but also the anticipation of additional error sources, considering the acceptable threshold values of decoding techniques and calibration errors for real applications and security proofs.
- Efficiency. In terms of efficiency and overall code performance, estimated times (for different prospective states of quantum processor advancement) for quantum key generation through these techniques are simulated, and the circumstances under which each may be most convenient are identified.
- Components demands. Increased demand for quality of the optics involved in the QKD protocol is expected. Protocols of this nature further increase the demand for high-quality transmissions, especially regarding photon sources, which may have a significant impact on both implementability and its associated costs.
- Overhead. Additional overhead needs are projected in terms of code design, number of qubits required depending on the use case, as well as measurement operators necessary for error detection and correction. Consequently, partial limits have been found on the amount of data that can be transmitted in a QKD system that integrates this methodology, which is projected to be overcome when widely available quantum hardware reaches sufficient maturity.
- Side channel attacks. Possible vulnerabilities to quantum hacking are preliminarily identified, and a testing method is suggested for this type of QECC-based QKD systems.
In addition to the previous analyses, the authors note that one of the most significant features of -both of- the codes here analyzed is that they carry out the identification of errors that affect quantum states at the time of reception, while preserving the encoded quantum information in photons. In this sense, a protocol of these characteristics allows to anticipate, in some applications, the error correction process to the security analysis (although the syndromes of each of the states can be stored classically and the correction processed once the QBER estimation is finished). This can constitute a significant disadvantage in unnecessary computational energy costs when the transmission is not considered secure, but may also be exploited for beneficial applications on certain use cases.
With all of the above, the work here presented collects the results on the aforementioned considerations, quantitative cost analysis and future feasibility prospects of this QECC-QKD proposal, as well as details on design and integration considerations, and requirements of both the QKD and quantum hardware components that support this type of implementation.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=117><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Quantum Cryptanalysis of Affine Cipher</div><div class=paper-authors>Mahima Mary Mathews (IIIT Kottayam);

We argue that our new protocol is not only experimentally easier, as it does not require tomography of the polarization degree of freedom, but also allows for a clean security analysis without assumptions that were implicitly hidden in earlier analyses of similar and related protocols.
We build a realistic noise model that takes environmental photons, dark counts, channel losses and non-unit detection efficiency into account and show that our new protocol allows secure key rates for twice as many environmental photons than comparable protocols available in literature. We want to highlight that while the security analysis of our protocol is rigorous and clean, the compared key rates for the compared protocol are actually only an upper bound (due to the assumptions implicitly hidden described earlier), so our new protocol outperforms previous settings by at least a factor of 2.
Current free-space QKD implementations are only operable during night when environmental photons are low, but fail to provide secure keys during twilight and daytime, which is a major obstacle towards broad practical usage.

One common feature of all protocols that we study is that Alice's source does not need any additional expensive components except state-of-the-art beamsplitters, therefore we call it `cheap source'.

In our work, we calculate asymptotic secret key rates for a range of parameters and different trust scenarios and show that in the asymptotic limit multi-user DM CV-QKD is possible for distances relevant for mid-sized urban area networks between at least 16 user.

Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate witness, known as a Bell inequality, difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, however achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which are often incompatible with optimal randomness generation. As a result we find a trade-off between maximum randomness and Bell violation. Understanding this trade-off for more than two parties has not been explored, and would inform the best way to generate DI randomness in this setting. Moreover, suitable techniques that enable maximum randomness certification for arbitrarily many parties are missing. Here, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations exhibiting a violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. We find that maximum quantum violation and maximum randomness are incompatible for any even number of parties, with incompatibility diminishing as the number of parties grow, and conjecture the precise trade-off. We also show that maximum MABK violation is not necessary for maximum randomness for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a new technique for randomness certification, which we call "expanding Bell inequalities". Our technique allows one to take a bipartite Bell expression, known as the seed, and transform it into a multipartite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=123><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Advantage of the key relay protocol over secure network coding</div><div class=paper-authors>Go Kato (NICT);

Future transactions will likely be secured by quantum means such as point-to-point quantum key distribution and more complex quantum protocols. Quantum key distribution has the potential to revolutionize secure communication, but it is often limited by device imperfections and environmental factors such as weather conditions. Currently, quantum key distribution schemes based on orbital angular momentum-carrying optical beams employ conventional settings. As a result, various attacks, such as detector side-channel attacks, are possible, and these beams are subject to spatial aberrations because of atmospheric turbulence and poor weather conditions. As a result, we present a novel approach to measurement device-independent quantum key distribution scheme using vortex vector modes and scalar beams that is capable of achieving high key rates even under diverse weather conditions, including clear skies, light rain, and fog. Furthermore, adopting this approach maximizes the advantages of both orbital angular momentum states and measurement device-independent quantum key distribution. According to our implementation, a secure key can be transmitted up to a maximum distance of approximately 178 kilometers under clear conditions, and we can transmit signals up to a comparable distance of approximately 160 kilometers under adverse weather conditions. Since these distances are comparable, this work presents a significant advance, illustrating how measurement device-independent quantum key distribution can be implemented using vortex vector modes. Most significantly, results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, opening up new possibilities for secure long-distance communication under adverse weather conditions.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=131><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Twin-field quantum key distribution with three mutually unbiased bases</div><div class=paper-authors>Yao Zhou (CAS Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, USTC);

However, the performance of the key distillation process requires computing power and involves the exchange of messages via classical channels.
Therefore, we evaluate the performance by a network simulator before performing evaluations on the actual equipment.
In this paper, we focus on the behavior of classical communication paths in the multiplexed QKD system, which is a problem in studying the key distillation process, and we evaluate it with the simulator. Specifically, we clarify the relationship between the required performance of the key distillation process (i.e., throughput) and the target SKR, which is necessary to realize a part of the key distillation process in hardware.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=134><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Impossibility of probabilistic Quantum Private Queries</div><div class=paper-authors>Silvia Onofri (Scuola Normale Superiore);

New way of delegated quantum computation solutions continues to be introduced by researchers. The basic functionality of delegated quantum computation enables a classical client to delegates quantum computation related jobs to remote untrusted server with appropriate security measures. However, only very few techniques are addressed the security challenges and its feasibility to implement in practice. One of the solution is quantum trusted execution environment (Q-TEE), which ensures a secure and practical way to build a remote quantum computing server with classical client. In this work, we explore some new features of a quantum-TEE (QTEE), which can be seen as aiding secure computation on a quantum computer.
It is reasonable to expect that a QTEE may be required to authenticate classical entities relating to a particular quantum computation. For example, a client, which has submitted a particular job, may require a proof that the quantum computation was indeed executed in that particular computer. Such a QTEE may be envisaged to be using a post-quantum signature scheme like DILITHIUM or Falcon. The quantum computing platform provider would use its secret key to sign various classical entities. The signature can be verified by using the provider's public key. We propose a design of a QTEE which uses Tokenized Signature Scheme (TSS). We also point out that such a QTEE has certain advantages over the naive DS-based ones.
Ben-David and Sattath introduced the primitive called (public key) Tokenized Signature Scheme, which can be used in a situation where a owner wants to delegate the power to sign to a signer. The owner, after generating the signing and verification keys (using PPT called KeyGen) (similar to key generation in a DS), creates a certain number of quantum tokens (using QPT called TokenGen) and gives them to designated signers. The signers authenticate classical messages (using QPT called Sign) by generating a classical string called signature, on behalf of the owner and at her behest, using the owner-provided tokens. The verification (using PPT called Vrfy) can be run by anyone using the public key, the signature and the message. The authors also give a construction of TSS using subspace states.
A quantum computation platform provider can generate its own key pair and generate tokens. The computers owned by the service provider may be equipped with a QTEE based on a candidate TSS scheme. The quantum tokens are loaded onto the QTEE, which are used for signing. We point out some advantages of such a construction. Firstly, the secret key of the owner is never revealed and all the computers controlled by the provider authenticate in the same manner. Secondly, the trust assumption on the QTEE may be relaxed. A secure TSS is expected to have the following unforgeability property. An adversarial signer can not sign n+1 messages if it has only n tokens. Thirdly, in a situation where the client pays for such authentication services, quantum tokens can be budgeted and monetized.
A complete design of a QTEE, supporting various secure quantum computation related requirements, may be achived with a TSS at its core. A TSS supporting aggregation and aggregated-verification brings in added advantage. Meaningful analogues of remote attestation (RA) and direct anonymous attestation (DAA) in this setting may also be explored. The development of quantum- based TEE techniques enables service providers to implement proprietary quantum computing devices in practice. Also, it allows classical users to perform remote quantum computation at very high security levels.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=144><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Practical implementation of a simplified BB84 protocol resilient to source imperfections</div><div class=paper-authors>Ana Blázquez Coído (Vigo Quantum Communication Center);

While the original study considers the noiseless setting, many subsequent studies extended this result to more general settings. However, all of them focused only on the communication speed in various noisy settings. While dense coding with the noiseless setting realizes twice communication speed, it also realizes quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) as follows.In dense coding, the sender, Alice, and the receiver, Bob, share perfect Bell states and Alice encodes her message by application of a unitary operation. Since Alice's local state is a completely mixed state, the eavesdropper, Eve, cannot obtain any information about the message even when Eve intercepts the transmitted quantum state. However, it is not easy to share a perfect Bell state. Hence, we need to consider secure communication under imperfect shared state. Specifically, we study secure direct communication by using a general preshared quantum state and a generalization of dense coding. In this scenario, Alice is allowed to apply a unitary operation on the preshared state to encode her message, and the set of allowed unitary operations forms a group. To decode the message, Bob is allowed to apply a measurement across his own system and the system he receives. In the worst scenario, we guarantee that Eve obtains no information for the message even when Eve access the joint system between the system that she intercepts and her original system of the preshared state.
For a practical application, we construct a modular wiretap code by concatenating inverse universal hashing and an arbitrary error correcting code. Combining the wiretap code with error verification, we propose a concrete protocol for the private dense coding model and derive an upper bound of information leakage in the finite-length setting. We also discuss how to apply our scenario to the case with discrete Weyl-Heisenberg representation when the preshared state is unknown. In this case, Pauli encoding operation and Pauli channel are considered. Hence, our protocol can be applied many similar tasks.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=148><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Semi-Quantum Copy-Protection and More</div><div class=paper-authors>Céline Chevalier (CRED, DIENS);

When performing an information task with an unreliable quantum resource, it is incorrect to treat the random variables associated with repeated experimental trials as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). To certify the performance of such a task, one can make a random decision in each trial, either to spot-check some property of the quantum resource or to utilize the resource for the task. The task considered can be quantum key distribution, quantum randomness expansion, verifiable quantum computation, or resource allocation in quantum networks. Unfortunately, existing methods for certifying quantum performance through spot-checking are not suitable for non-i.i.d. repeated trials without additional assumptions. Here we present a novel method to address this challenge. The method works efficiently with a finite number of non-i.i.d. trials.

Here we present an FPGA-controlled prepare-and-measure BB84 polarization-based decoy state protocol using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Our setup uses three separate LEDs driven by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that go through different optical paths that set the state of polarization. Each LED is connected to two GPIO pins via a different resistive path. By setting one pin to high impedance and driving the other with a nanosecond-scale electrical signal, we can choose between signal and decoy states. We can thus send 3 signal states, 3 decoy states, and 3 vacuum states. To prevent side-channel attacks multi-source QKD systems require that each state is indistinguishable from the others in the spatial, spectral, and temporal degrees-of-freedom on the photon. We do this by passing the 3 photonic wavepackets through the same single-mode fiber and 1-nm-bandwith spectral filter and use dynamic shifting of the FPGA phase-locked-loops to control the phase and the width of the electrical pulses that drive the LEDs, which allows us to control the optical pulses produced by the LEDs. Both spectral and temporal profiles are shown in Figure 1. We control the timing of the photonic wavepackets to a resolution of 78 ps. Additionally, we use the FPGA to generate true random states as required by the BB84 protocol. To quantify the indistinguishability of Alice’s various states, we use the mutual information to calculate the fraction of the final sifted key that an eavesdropper would know after making temporal and/or spectral measurements on every state that is sent. We are able to achieve 2.39e-05 and 4.31e-05 mutual information fraction leaked in the spectral and temporal waveforms, respectively. Furthermore we put our scheme into practice with a simple tabletop QKD setup where we are able to achieve 1.7% quantum bit-error rate (QBER) in the L/R bases and 2.1% QBER in the H/V bases. Additionally, our system's SWaP restrictions make it very desirable for highly mobile platforms such as drones.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=153><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Finite-size effects of decoy state methods</div><div class=paper-authors>Lars Kamin (University of Waterloo);

Qubit-based synchronization protocols directly use the transmitted quantum states and thus avoid the need for additional classical synchronization hardware, but previous approaches sacrifice secure key either directly or indirectly. Here, we introduce a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm that incorporates all published information to efficiently find the clock offset without sacrificing any secure key [1]. Additionally, the output of the algorithm is a probability, which allows us to quantify our confidence in the synchronization.
Our experimental system employs an efficient three-state BB84 prepare-and-measure protocol with decoy states. Our algorithm exploits the correlations between Alice’s published basis and mean photon number choices (which must already be published for the protocol) and Bob’s measurement outcomes to probabilistically determine the most likely clock offset. We perform cross-correlations using Fast Fourier Transforms to count the number of each type of event pairing for each potential offset (e.g., how many times Alice sent a decoy state in the horizontal/vertical polarization basis and Bob registered a click in the horizontal detector). Taking these along with a lookup table for the probabilities of the different event pairings, we determine the synchronization probability of the different potential offsets using Bayesian analysis.
To demonstrate the robust nature of this algorithm, we tracked its performance using simulated data with varying parameters. We find that we can achieve a 95% synchronization confidence using a string length of only 4,140 communication bin widths, meaning we can tolerate clock drift approaching 1 part in 4,140 in this example when simulating this system with a dark count probability per communication bin width of 8⨉10-4 and a received mean photon number of 0.01. The relationship between the received mean photon number and the number of communication bin widths required to achieve a 95% synchronization confidence is shown in Fig. 1.
We applied this algorithm to data collected from our drone-to-done QKD experiments, with a received mean photon number of 0.043, achieving quantum bit error rates of 0.0106, 0.0287, and 0.0361 for our 3 states.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=155><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Experimental anonymous quantum conference key agreement</div><div class=paper-authors>Jonathan Webb (Heriot-Watt University);

However, quantum dots (QD) often inherently possess a fine structure splitting (FSS). Since the entangled photonic state in the presence of non-zero FSS is oscillating, one must settle for a lower efficiency source through temporal post-selection or a lower measured entanglement fidelity. In both cases, the overall key rate is reduced.
Our QKD analysis shows that this trade-off can be overcome by constructing a time-resolved QKD protocol where all photon pairs emitted by a QD with non-zero FSS can be used in secret key generation. This protocol works only when the detection system's temporal resolution is much smaller than the FSS period. By implementing our protocol, higher key rates can be achieved as compared to previous QKD experiments with QD entangled photon pair sources.
Additionally, unlike previous security analyses that assume perfect qubit states, we rigorously bound the effect of any multi-photon components of the optical state on the key rate, which is more applicable to practical implementations.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=158><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Postselection technique for optical prepare-and-measure QKD protocols</div><div class=paper-authors>Devashish Tupkary (Institute for Quantum Computing);

photon source. While this assumption poses no significant issues when the channel loss is
low, high loss can have a detrimental impact on the system's performance. To overcome
high loss, the most intuitive solution is to increase the gain of entangled photon pairs by
sending a large quantity of them. However, high-gain sources tend to degrade the
quantum quality of entangled photon pair sources. We derived the density matrix of the
quantum state in the distribution of polarization-entangled photon pairs under the non-
symmetric channel losses with threshold detectors. We analyzed the variation of the CHSH
inequality parameter S and the effective photon state transfer probability 𝑁𝑚 by changing
the non-linear gain γ. The increase and subsequent decrease in Nm with increasing γ can
be interpreted as follows: when γ is small, the state is not properly transmitted due to high
loss, but as γ increases, the error probability, such as double-click events, increases due to
the influence of multi-photon events, leading to a decrease in Nm. This result indicates the
need to optimize the brightness of the light source for practical implementation in
quantum information technologies. This study is expected to contribute to the analysis of
discrete variable quantum key distribution(DVQKD) systems like BBM92, E91, and long-

However, one significant challenge faced during these trials is ensuring the stability of QKD operation. The instability of QKD operation is caused by the two factors: random fluctuations in polarization of photon over time and time drift of the photon as it traverses the deployed optical fiber. These issues are unavoidable due to the inability to accurately estimate and control factors such as temperature, vibration, and stress in the deployed optical fiber. To address this instability, various solutions based on active or passive optics have been proposed.
In this paper, we present an active optics-based simple polarization stabilizer utilizing an optical polarizer, an active polarization controller, and a single photon detector. For the fast operation, we utilize only 2 out of the 4 axes of the polarization controller for the stabilizer. The experimental results verify the stability of the stabilizer.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=162><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Reliable lower bounds for practical variants of Coherent One-Way protocols</div><div class=paper-authors>Shihong Pan (Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo);

Originally, the research on CV QKD protocols mostly focused on Gaussian modulation (see review [1]), where one assumes that Alice can continuously displace coherent states according to a 2D Gaussian distribution. This modulation allows the security proofs to take advance of Gaussian optimality conditions, but experimental implementations can only reach this pattern up to some finite discretization. Another approach is to directly use a discrete-modulated (DM) CV QKD protocol. Here, Alice is required to prepare a finite number of displaced coherent states, aiming for a higher experimental simplicity, with the drawback of higher theoretical complexity. Recently, new security proofs such as [2] and corresponding experiments [3,4] could show the feasibility of systems using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with 64 and 256 displaced states. However, the security proof was limited to the asymptotic regime and since the experiments did not use implemented error correction codes, one could only estimate the achievable key rates, but could not generate the secret key itself.
In this poster, we demonstrate experiments with a protocol with a smaller constellation size of four coherent states that share the same amplitude but are shifted by 90° in phase (QPSK modulation). We exploit a recently published security proof providing tight secret key rates for collective attacks even in the finite size regime [5]. Furthermore, we show that the QPSK data is compatible with our implemented low density parity check (LDPC) codes for binary symmetric channels. This allows us to perform the full QKD protocol from experimental quantum state exchange to classical post processing and to generate a secret key shared between Alice and Bob. For this purpose, we use a laboratory system based on polarization encoding in the Stokes parameters which is equivalent to a QPSK pattern in phase space. This scheme is designed to cope with the challenges of a turbulent atmospheric channel. While the fluctuating nature of such a channel can be targeted by sub-binning the transmission channels [6], the atmosphere is in general non-birefringent, allowing for atmospheric quantum communications [7].

This problem is computationally exhaustive and poses one of important challenges for industrial implementation of self-testing integrated QRNG devices. Furthermore, classical statistical testing cannot in principle confirm the quantum non-determinism (from which the QRNG device can deviate due to its implementation imperfections). Instead, classical testing can confirm that up to certain parameters threshold, deterministic patterns were not detected. The device independent QRNG schemes are based on quantum entanglement, which is a non-classical resource that can be verified in terms of quantum measurements non-classical correlations statistically violating Bell type (e.g. CHSH) inequalities for classical limits on such correlations. This reults in a fundamental (independent from a technical implementation) confirmation that the process used to generate randomness based on entangled quantum states is indeed non-deterministic. In this paper we describe a series of recent experimental developments focused on generating quantum entanglement based randomness in a quntum optics device-independent approach, with validation of the randomness through experimentally verified violation of the CHSH inequality [1]. The experimental setup for entanglement based QRNG involves generation of entanglement in photon polarizations in the SPDC type II process with a single-photon detectors (SPAD) for quantum measurements of entangled photons. Statistical processing of the measurements outcomes shows violation of the classical limits on the correlations, violating the CHSH inequality and hence proving that the QRNG generated randomness is based on a quantum, non-deterministic process. The further direction for this research is towards miniaturization of the robust quantum optics setups to be more adequate for integrated entanglement QRNG devices. This work is part of the NCBR research and development project (contract no.

Most QKD research focuses on "device-dependent" protocols whose security is conditioned on their quantum devices operating within specified tolerances. These assumptions on device operation render device-dependent protocols vulnerable to attacks that exploit the differences in real devices and their models in security proofs, and hence threaten the security of such protocols. Alternatively, Device-independent (DI) QKD seeks to achieve security with minimal assumptions on quantum devices by relying on quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities, overcoming this short-coming of device-dependent QKD.
Our work is motivated by the following two observations. First, DIQKD is more secure but has worse noise and loss tolerances than device-dependent QKD. This point has motivated investigations into new techniques to improve these tolerance thresholds such as random key generation, random post-selection, noisy pre-processing and advantage distillation, the last of which we investigate, and which describes a two-way communication procedure in the error correction step of the protocol. Second, the precise circumstances in which DIQKD is possible are unclear, since not all correlations that violate Bell inequalities can be used to distill a secret key in DIQKD. Under the independent and identically distributed (IID) collective attacks framework, previous work sought to resolve both problems by implementing DIQKD with an advantage distillation protocol called the repetition-code protocol. The authors derived both a sufficient and a conjectured necessary condition for security based on the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, the significance of their results was limited by a gap between the two security conditions, which prevented the calculation of tight noise tolerance bounds and suggested that the fidelity is not the right quantity to consider to characterize exactly when key distillation in DIQKD is possible.
Furthermore, in our work we replace the fidelity in the security proofs with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a measure of distinguishability in symmetric hypothesis testing, and achieve equivalent sufficient and necessary conditions for security for the repetition-code DIQKD protocol under the i.i.d collective attacks framework. Consequently, our work strongly indicates that quantum Chernoff divergence is the relevant quantity to describe the security of the repetition-code DIQKD protocol. With our new security condition, we show that the noise tolerance thresholds of the repetition-code DIQKD protocol outperform even one-way DIQKD protocols implemented with noisy pre-processing and random key measurements.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=173><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Robust Global Quantum Networks</div><div class=paper-authors>Jan-Michael Mol (German Aerospace Center (DLR));

To overcome associated losses in even the best optical fibers on ground, operating repeater nodes in space to utilize low-loss inter-satellite links may prove to be the only viable strategy. Successfully deployed QKD experiments and quantum technology in space, brings this idea closer to realization.

However, the loss tolerance of SPS-based QKD is compromised by photon number splitting (PNS) attacks against non-negligible multiphoton emissions. Decoy state (DS) techniques mitigate against PNS attacks, with WCP-DS QKD over several hundred km in fibre being demonstrated. Here, we adapt the DS method to any practical SPS that can easily generate multiple photon number distributions (PND) by attenuating its original photon emissions. Hence, we provide finite-key security bounds for a Multi-PND (adapted 2-Decoy) protocol using Efficient BB84 with optimised parameters. We use a particular true quantum dot source to compare its key rate generation with a Single-PND (adapted Non-Decoy) protocol for several finite block sizes. As expected, the Multi-PND gives higher key rates than the Single-PND, except for considerably small blocks. Moreover, the Multi-PND protocol goes beyond 200 km of tolerable fibre distance for high acquisition times. In this work, we set a generalised method to employ the DS techniques with any realistic SPS and further research may be done implementing distinct SPS characteristics.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=175><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Unprovable Security of statistical NIZK in the Quantum Setting</div><div class=paper-authors>Chuhan Lu (Portland State University);

In this work, we extend this impossibility result to a quantum scenario where quantum computations and communications are incorporated into the protocol. The classical result is demonstrated using the meta-reduction paradigm, which is a typical technique employed to generate cryptographic impossibility results. In our work, we extend this technique to the quantum setting to prove our results.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=paper-slides></div></div></li><li value=176><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Time-bin Entanglement Swapping</div><div class=paper-authors>Samantha I.

Entanglement is typically achieved by having two particles created from the same source [1]. However, creating quantum networks and internet requires distributing and manipulating quantum states between remote nodes through protocols such as quantum entanglement. Here we report high-fidelity entanglement swapping using time-bin qubits, with the aim of distributing entanglement between national laboratories in the United States.
