										<p>Randomness is a fundamental resource in modern cryptography. The generation of uniformly random bits using quantum mechanics, while still experimentally challenging, is straightforward from a purely theoretical point of view. Nevertheless, for cryptographic applications it is often crucial to ensure that the random bits generated are completely secure and uncorrelated with any potential “adversary”. For instance, one may imagine that the manufacturer of the randomness-generation device introduced “backdoor entanglement” between the device and her own lab, thereby potentially gaining access to the “random” bits generated.</p>
										<p>In this talk I will address the question of generating certifiable, fully secure random bits. I will describe a simple protocol that stretches an initial (log <span class="math">n</span>)-bit random string into n random bits. The bits generated are secure, i.e. appear uniformly random from the point of view of any (quantum) adversary, based only on the verification of a simple statistical test based on the CHSH inequality. No assumptions on the randomness-generating device are made other than that is is formed of two components that do not signal to each other. These results strengthen and extend previous work by Colbeck (2009), who first introduced the task of device-independent randomness expansion, and Pironio <span style="font-style: italic;">et al.</span> (Nature 2010), who gave the first rigorous analysis in the non-adversarial setting.</p>
										<p>The proof of security of our protocol relies on a technique, the “quantum reconstruction paradigm”, previously introduced in the analysis of the task of randomness extraction in connection with privacy amplification. I will introduce that technique and show how it is applied to the setting of randomness expansion.</p>

										<p>The goal of randomness extraction is to distill (almost) perfect randomness from a weak source of randomness. When the source yields a classical string X, many extractor constructions are known. Yet, when considering a physical randomness source, X is itself ultimately the result of a measurement on an underlying quantum system. When characterizing the power of a source to supply randomness it is hence a natural question to ask, how much classical randomness we can extract from a quantum system. To tackle this question we here take on the study of quantum to classical randomness extractors (QC-extractors). We provide constructions of QC-extractors based on measurements in a full set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), and certain single qubit measurements. As the first application, we show that any QC-extractor gives rise to entropic uncertainty relations with respect to quantum side information. Such relations were previously only known for two measurements. As the second application, we resolve the central open question in the noisy-storage model [Wehner et al., PRL 100, 220502 (2008)] by linking security to the quantum capacity of the adversary’s storage device.</p>

										<p>In this work, we propose the concept of self-testing QKD which is based on a novel local self-testing method. In particular, devices are tested locally independent of the quantum channel, that is, Alice and Bob perform Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests, an application of Bell's theorem on their own devices, independent of each other and the quantum channel. Note that because the quantum channel is not included in CHSH test, the channel loss cannot be used to open the detection loophole. The security assessment of the quantum channel follows the channel estimation technique of BB84 QKD protocol, i.e., checking for errors in the bases X and Z. Therefore, by deriving the relation between CHSH test and a recent security proof technique (the smooth version of entropic uncertainty relation), the finite-key security proof is obtained under minimal assumptions. Also, our result – a lower bound on the secret key rate – is intuitively related to the almost tight finite-key analysis of BB84 QKD protocol and it differs only by a term that is dependent on the CHSH value. Most importantly, we obtained secret key rates that are comparable to ones of BB84 QKD protocol.</p>

										<p>Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1) public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a “classical” hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the “black-box” version of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is unconditionally secure. Even in Wiesner's original setting – quantum money that can only be verified by the bank – we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in Wiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based  scheme of Farhi <span style="font-style: italic;">et al</span>. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis – matching the original intuition for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables.</p>

										<p>Device-independent quantum cryptographic schemes aim to guarantee security to users based only on the output statistics of any components used, and without the need to verify their internal functionality. Since this would protect users against untrustworthy or incompetent manufacturers, sabotage or device degradation, this idea has excited much interest, and many device-independent schemes have been proposed. Here we identify a critical weakness of device-independent quantum cryptographic protocols that rely on public communication between secure laboratories. Untrusted devices may record their inputs and outputs and reveal information about them via publicly discussed outputs during later runs. Reusing devices thus compromises the security of a protocol and risks leaking secret data. Possible defences include securely destroying or isolating used devices. However, these are costly and often impractical. We briefly consider other possible defences available in scenarios where device reuse is restricted.</p>

										<p>Quantum cryptography promises the distribution of cryptographic keys secured by fundamental laws of quantum physics. However, results in quantum hacking have demonstrated that the information theoretic security of quantum cryptography protocols does not guarantee security for actual implementations. Most notable are attacks against the vulnerabilities of single photon detectors [1-4]. In this talk we will report the first proof-of-principle demonstration of a new protocol that removes the threat of any such attack [5]. We demonstrated the protocol over 80 km of spooled fibre as well as across different locations within the city of Calgary [6], confirming this protocol as a realistic approach to secure communication and demonstrating the possibility for controlled two-photon interference in a real-world environment, which is a remaining obstacle to realizing quantum repeaters and quantum networks.</p>

									<p>We prove that Gaussian continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols, using a Gaussian distribution of coherent or squeezed states and homodyne or heterodyne measurement, are secure against arbitrary attacks.</p>
									<p>Our proof exploits the speciﬁc symmetries in phase-space of Gaussian QKD protocols to prove that once a simple test over the measurement outcomes succeeds, the global state shared between Alice and Bob is well decribed by assigning a low dimensional Hilbert space to each mode.

									<p>The maximal transmission distance of optical quantum communication is reaching a hard limit imposed by the intrinsic loss of the transmission medium, e.g. optical fibre.  A quantum repeater promises to push that limit towards much longer, potentially intercontinental distances. Its implementation relies on the development of efficient and long-lived quantum memories that can store and retrieve the quantum properties of light. Sources of photonic entanglement, tailored for quantum memories, are also necessary and represent a challenging experimental task.</p>
									<p>I will review the efforts of our group towards the realization of quantum memories based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals (REIC) as well as a matching source of photon pair. This approach has recently allowed us to demonstrate several features that are of great importance for quantum repeaters, and for quantum networks in general.</p>
									<p>After a brief introduction, I will show how we have successfully entangled two neodymium-doped crystals in a heralded fashion. I will then show how polarization qubits encoded in true single photons can be stored in such crystals, despite their intrinsic birefringence and polarization-dependant absorption. I will finally present an on-demand quantum memory exploiting the long hyperfine coherence time of europium ions to store light for up to 8 ms. Our results highlight the great potential of REIC for quantum repeaters.</p>

									<p>The ability to send quantum information encoded in photons over large distances is hampered by the unavoidable loss in the communication channel. In classical communication, channel-loss is alleviated by amplifying the information carrier, however, due to the no-cloning theorem for quantum states, this approach is not viable for quantum communication channels. Instead long-distance quantum communication can be enabled by quantum-repeaters, which serve to distribute entanglement over the entire channel by means of entanglement swapping between subdivision of the channel [1]. In order to synchronize the process of entanglement swapping between adjacent subdivisions, quantum repeaters must incorporate quantum memories [2]. A quantum memory is a device that has the ability to (reversibly) map quantum states between photons and atoms [3]. In most of the quantum repeater architectures proposed to date, it is required that quantum memories feature recall on demand. Other desirable attributes of a quantum memory are high fidelity and efficiency, long storage times, and the possibility to simultaneously store multiple carriers of quantum information, i.e. record multiple photonic modes. The combination of a quantum state storage protocol based on an atomic frequency comb (AFC) [4] with rare-earth-ion doped crystals cooled to cryogenic temperatures as storage materials [5] has been shown to meet many of these requirements. In particular, it is well suited for storage of temporally multiplexed photons [6,7]. Yet, despite first proof-of-principle demonstrations [8], recalling the quantum information at a desired time (i.e. read-out on demand) with broadband, single-photon-level pulses remains an outstanding challenge. Fortunately, the AFC protocol allows not only for multimode storage in the time domain, but also in the frequency domain.
									<p>Here, we will present the first experimental demonstration of frequency-multiplexed storage of attenuated laser pulses followed by read-out on demand in the frequency domain, pointing to a quantum repeater architecture based on frequency multiplexing. Our work is based on the AFC protocol and employs a Tm-doped LiNbO3 waveguide cooled to 4 K [9,10]. Using a serrodyne sideband chirping technique we prepare several frequency-combs in the atomic absorption spectrum. Each section of AFC is a few 100 MHz wide and since we vary the comb-tooth spacing in each section we prepare them with different storage times on the order of 20-150 ns. After the AFC preparation, we send a probe pulse, which is modulated to contain several frequency components that correspond to the centre frequencies of the AFC sections. The mean photon number in each mode is set to be around one. As the probe pulse is mapped to our quantum memory the different frequency modes are mapped to different sections of the AFC and thus recalled at different times. The recalled pulses pass through a frequency filter with a bandwidth matching a single frequency mode. Before frequency filtering we are able to impart again a frequency shift on the recalled pulses, which can hence be set to pass the spectral filter. This constitutes recall on demand of a particular frequency mode. Our multimode quantum memory is highly flexible and can be set to recall all modes at the same time, and adapted to broader or narrower frequency modes. In addition it has been shown to faithfully store time bin qubits in pure and entangled states and preserve all degrees of freedom of the photonic wavefunction [9,11].
									<p>Finally, we will argue that, in view of a quantum repeater, our approach based on a multimode memory with read-out on demand in the frequency domain is equivalent to temporal multiplexing and read-out on demand in the temporal domain. This overcomes one further obstacle to building quantum repeaters using rare-earth-ion doped crystals as memory devices.

A newly developed hardware distillation engine allows for continuous operation of secret key distribution up to 1 Mbps.

									<p>We investigate two-party cryptographic protocols that are secure under assumptions motivated by physics, namely relativistic assumptions (no-signalling) and quantum mechanics. In particular, we discuss split models, i.e. models in which certain parties are not allowed to communicate during certain phases of the protocol, for the purpose of bit commitment. We find the minimal splits that are necessary to evade the Mayers-Lo-Chau no-go argument and present protocols that achieve security in these split models.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, we introduce the notion of local versus global commands, a subtle issue that arises when the split committer is required to delegate agents to perform the open phase separately, without communication. We argue that classical protocols are insecure in the global command model, even when the committer is split. On the other hand, we provide a rigorous security proof in the global command model for a quantum protocol proposed by Kent. The proof employs two fundamental principles of modern physics, the no-signalling property of relativity and the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.</p>

									<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />Quantum mechanics is perhaps the most profound revolution ever to occur in our understanding of Nature. While born with last century, it appeared for many decades to be just a game, played by physicists strictly for the sake of advancing pure knowledge, without any impact on everyday life. And then, quantum mechanics gave birth to the transistor, and society was transformed forever. The physicists’ “game” ushered in the Information Age, which is the signature of the 20th century, just as the 19th century was the Machine Age. But we are poised to experience a second quantum revolution in which the full power of the quantum world will be unleashed in ways never before thought possible, transmitting and processing information with unconditionally secure communication and computers powerful beyond imagination. Indeed, the 21st century will go down in history as the Quantum Age.</p>
									<p><strong>About the speaker:</strong><br />Professor of computer science and Canada Research Chair at the Université de Montréal, Gilles Brassard laid the foundations of quantum cryptography at a time when only a handful of people worldwide were interested in quantum information science. He is among the inventors of quantum teleportation, which is universally recognized as a fundamental keystone of the discipline. Editor-in-Chief for Journal of Cryptology from 1991 until 1997, he is the author of three books that have been translated into eight languages. He is a Fellow of the Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada, of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and of the International Association for Cryptologic Research. Among his many awards, we note the Prix Marie-Victorin, the Rank Prize in Opto-Electronics, the NSERC Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering and the Killam Prize for natural sciences. Foreign member of the Academia Europaea, he was awarded a honorary doctorate by the ETH in Zürich.</p>

									<p>Quantum information technology has been developing rapidly in last two decades. Very recently, quite a few optical quantum key distribution networks have been reported, enabling preliminary practical applications in secure information transfer. Meanwhile, a number of significant progresses based on quantum network have also been made in the research of linear optical quantum computing, simulation and metrology. However, on the way towards large-scale optical quantum network serious problems occur. On the one hand, the distance of fiber‐based quantum communication is limited, due to intrinsic fiber loss and decreasing of entanglement quality caused by the noisy environment. On the other hand, the probabilistic feature of single and entangled photon sources would also cause an exponentially increasing overhead for large-scale quantum network.</p>
									<p>To solve the above problems, quantum repeaters and/or transmission of optical quantum bits over free space channel can be efficiently exploited for future wide‐area realization of quantum communication. In addition, memory built-in quantum repeaters would also enable scalable linear optical quantum computing, simulation and high precision measurement. In this talk I will present some recent experiments from our group, including eight-photon entanglement, topological quantum error-correction, quantum repeater and efficient and long-lived quantum memory, and entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation over 100 km-scale free-space quantum channels. These experiments show the promising future possibility towards scalable quantum network with photons and atoms.</p>

									<p>Is the quantum state real – a property of the system it is assigned to? Or does it represent only our (incomplete) knowledge of the system? It is possible that the second alternative – the epistemic character of the quantum state – comes about because quantum mechanics is obtained by some statistical averaging over a “complete” theory of nature. Such models are often called “hidden variable” models, because the true variables describing the system, the ontic state, are not accessible.</p>
									<p>Recently Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph [1] showed that, assuming the natural assumption of “preparation independence”, epistemic models of the quantum state are in contradiction with the predictions of quantum theory. “Preparation independence” means that independent preparations of systems correspond to a joint distribution (over the ontic states) is the product of individual distributions.</p>
									<p>Here we adopt a different approach. We show that, assuming both a form of continuity and separability (a weak form of preparation independence), epistemic interpretations of the quantum state are in contradiction with quantum theory. We also discuss some implications of “hidden-variable” models for cryptography.</p>
									<p>We then describe a simple high-precision experiment optics experiment that tests some of the predictions of continuous and separable epistemic models. The experiment is particularly simple. It involves attenuated coherent states in time bins of dimension up to 80 propagating in optical fibres. Our experimental results are in agreement with the predictions of quantum theory and provide strong constraints on possible epistemic extensions of quantum mechanics. These results are reported in [2].</p>

									<p>Quantum teleportation is a quintessential prerequisite of many quantum information processing protocols. By using quantum teleportation, one can circumvent the no-cloning theorem and faithfully transfer unknown quantum states to a party whose location is even unknown over arbitrary distances. Quantum teleportation can also be used to create entanglement between formally completely independent particles (i.e. entanglement swapping). The subsequent application of entanglement swapping might be utilized in a future quantum repeater, where in addition to entanglement swapping, local operations are performed to purify the teleported entanglement.</p>
									<p>Quantum repeaters will be of utmost importance in a future global quantum communication network, since they will allow overcoming photon loss exponentially depending on the link distance and hence enable quantum communication over arbitrary distances. The quantum channels in a future network will mostly consist of optical fibers, which are already widely installed. As an alternative, free-space connections will allow to quickly build up connections between parties with direct line-of-sight. Additionally, orbital free-space links, e.g. satellite-to-ground links or inter-satellite links, will allow the efficient global interconnection of regional quantum networks and of objects not having connection to the fiber network. In order to prove the feasibility of quantum teleportation under optical link attenuations that will arise in a future application scenario, the communication distance in teleportation needs to be extended.</p>
									<p>Here we report the first long-distance quantum teleportation experiment with active feed-forward in real time. The experiment employed two optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 km free space between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. The real-life long-distance environment implied a number of challenges for the present teleportation experiment. They resulted most significantly in the necessity to cope with an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio when using standard techniques, indeed too low for performing a successful experiment. To enhance it to a level making the experiment possible at all, we employed for the first time a combination of various cutting-edge techniques. Furthermore, the severe environmental conditions imposed demanding requirements onto the whole long-distance teleportation setup: link attenuation fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence, induced by the harsh meteorological situations including rapid temperature change, sand storms, rain, fog, strong wind and even snow.</p>
									<p>Our work proofs the feasibility of ground-based free-space quantum teleportation. Our quantum teleportation setup was able to achieve coincidence production rates and fidelities to cope with the optical link attenuation resulting from various experimental and technical challenges, which will arise in a quantum transmission between a ground-based transmitter to a low-earth-orbiting (LEO) satellite receiver31. Actually, some demands in our experiment were even more challenging since in satellite communication the atmospheric distances to be overcome are certainly lower than the distance between Tenerife and La Palma. This experiment represents a crucial step toward future quantum networks in space, which require space to ground quantum communication. The technology implemented in our experiment thus certainly reached the required maturity both for satellite and for long-distance ground communication. We expect that many of the features implemented here will be key blocks for a new area of fascinating experiments.</p>

									<p>In optical implementations of the phase-encoded BB84 protocol, the bit information is usually encoded in the phase of two consecutive photon pulses generated in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In the actual experimental realization, the loss in the arms of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is not balanced, for example because only one arm contains a lossy phase modulator. Therefore, the amplitudes of the pulses is not balanced, and the structure of the signals and measurements no longer corresponds to the (balanced) ideal BB84 protocol. Hence, the BB84 security analysis no longer applies in this scenario.</p>
									<p>We provide a security proof of the unbalanced phase-encoded BB84. The resulting key rate turns out to be lower than the key rate of the ideal BB84 protocol. Therefore, in order to guarantee security, the loss due to the phase modulator cannot be ignored.</p>

									<p>A fundamental task in modern cryptography is the joint computation of a function which has two inputs, one from Alice and one from Bob, such that neither of the two can learn more about the other's input than what is implied by the value of the function. In this work we show that any quantum protocol for the computation of a classical deterministic function that outputs the result to both parties (two-sided computation) and that is secure against a cheating Bob can be completely broken by a cheating Alice. Whereas it is known that quantum protocols for this task cannot be completely secure, our result implies that security for one party implies complete insecurity for the other. Our findings stand in stark contrast to recent protocols for weak coin tossing, and highlight the limits of cryptography within quantum mechanics. We remark that our conclusions remain valid, even if security is only required to be approximate.</p>

									<p>Apart from their foundational signicance, entropic uncertainty relations play a central role in proving the security of quantum cryptographic protocols. Of particular interest are thereby relations in terms of the smooth min-entropy for BB84 and six-state encodings. Previously, strong uncertainty relations were obtained which are valid in the limit of large block lengths. Here, we prove a new uncertainty relation in terms of the smooth min-entropy that is only marginally less strong, but has the crucial property that it can be applied to rather small block lengths. This paves the way for a practical implementation of many cryptographic protocols. As part of our proof we show tight uncertainty relations for a family of Renyi entropies that may be of independent interest.</p>

									<p>Attacks on cryptographic protocols are usually modeled by allowing an adversary to ask queries to an oracle. Security is then defined by requiring that as long as the queries satisfy some constraint, there is some problem the adversary cannot solve, such as compute a certain piece of information. Even if the protocol is quantum, the queries are typically classical, such as a choice of subset of players to corrupt. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally new model of quantum attacks on protocols, where the adversary is allowed to ask several classical queries in quantum superposition. This is a strictly stronger attack than the standard one, and we consider the security of several primitives in this model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is secure with threshold <span class="math">t</span> in the standard model is secure against superposition attacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to <span class="math">t/2</span>. This holds for all classical as well as a large class of quantum secret sharing schemes. We then consider zero-knowledge and first show that known protocols are not, in general, secure in our model by designing a superposition attack on the well-known zero-knowledge protocol for graph isomorphism. We then use our secret-sharing result to design zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP in the common reference string model. While our protocol is classical, it is sound against a cheating unbounded quantum prover and computational zero-knowledge even if the verifier is allowed a superposition attack. Finally, we consider multiparty computation and give a characterization of a class of protocols that can be shown secure, though not necessarily with efficient simulation. We show that this class contains non-trivial protocols that cannot be shown secure by running a classical simulator in superposition.</p>

									<p>Key establishment is a crucial primitive for building secure channels: in a multi-party setting, it allows two parties using only public authenticated communication to establish a secret session key which can be used to encrypt messages. But if the session key is compromised, the confidentiality of encrypted messages is typically compromised as well. Without quantum mechanics, key establishment can only be done under the assumption that some computational problem is hard. Since digital communication can be easily eavesdropped and recorded, it is important to consider the secrecy of information anticipating future algorithmic and computational discoveries which could break the secrecy of past keys, violating the secrecy of the confidential channel.</p>
									<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used generate secret keys that are secure against any future algorithmic or computational improvements. QKD protocols still require authentication of classical communication, however, which is most easily achieved using computationally secure digital signature schemes. It is generally considered folklore that QKD when used with computationally secure authentication is still secure against an unbounded adversary, provided the adversary did not break the authentication during the run of the protocol.</p>
									<p>We describe a security model for quantum key distribution based on traditional classical authenticated key exchange (AKE) security models. Using our model, we characterize the long-term security of the BB84 QKD protocol with computationally secure authentication against an eventually unbounded adversary. By basing our model on traditional AKE models, we can more readily compare the relative merits of various forms of QKD and existing classical AKE protocols. This comparison illustrates in which types of adversarial environments different quantum and classical key agreement protocols can be secure.</p>

									<p>To maintain a sustainable urban development, many metropolitan areas have adopted the ‘Smart City’ model. It is a strategic concept where a city provides its inhabitants the availability of knowledge communication by means of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). As the Smart City model relies heavily on information transfer, information security is of utmost importance. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an unique technology for providing encryption keys between remote parties with a directly quantifiable security; therefore it would be highly desirable to combine QKD with classical information transfer in a Smart community. QKD in the presence of classical data traffic has been demonstrated, however the secure key rates and transfer distances are far too low for broadband applications over Smart City distances (typically ranging from 30 km to 80 km). For example, a conferencing video would usually require 256 kbit/s secure key for one time pad encryption. The low quantum key transfer rate is primarily limited by the low single photon detection rate. With the novel self-differencing technique, GHz gating of the single photon detectors is possible, therefore allowing high speed quantum keys to be created for high bandwidth applications. Here in this paper, we present the first QKD system demonstration with sufficient secure key rate for one time pad encryption of video conferencing applications over metropolitan fibre distances. Secure keys in presence of error free classical data are demonstrated for distances up to 90 km. This demonstration is the first step towards enabling utmost secure data exchange for Smart City distances. We anticipate such demonstration will increase the level of confidence towards ICT infrastructures.</p>

								<div class="talk-abstract">
									<p>Quantum steering allows two parties to verify shared entanglement even if one measurement device is untrusted, as well as convincing an unbelieving party of the existence of entanglement.  I will discuss quantum steering in the contexts of recent experiments [1,2,3] steering the polarization degree of freedom for single photons.  The historical context as well as modern motivation for steering will be covered, as well as the similarities and differences in the various recent experiments.</p>
									<p>Our own work [1], demonstrating quantum steering with high efficiency (62%) in two measurement bases, will be discussed in detail, including the technical challenges in certifying the results due to measurement imperfections of various types.   We ultimately demonstrate a violation of some 48 standard deviations of the steering inequality most relevant to applications, which also happens to be the one most difficult to violate. The efficiency demonstrated in this experiment (62%) is half again as high as the previous world record for detection efficiency for an experiment in this context.</p>
									<p>I will conclude with our current research project – to implement semi-device-independent quantum key distribution [4], with security guaranteed by a steering inequality.  This lies in the gap between current QKD implementations and the ultimate security given by device-independent QKD, and, in practical situations, requires a detection efficiency some 10% higher again than our previous result, which should be achievable given the advances made since that result was published.</p>

									<p>We show that the maximum transmission distance of continuous-variable quantum key distribution in presence of a Gaussian noisy lossy channel can be arbitrarily increased using a heralded noiseless linear amplifier.

									<p>We demonstrate for the first time that long-distance quantum key distribution can be achieved with continuous variables, using only standard telecommunication components. Furthermore, we obtain a positive secret key rate over long distances even when taking into account finite-size effects. These results correspond to a practical implementation guaranteeing the strongest level of security achievable with QKD and show that continuous-variable quantum key distribution is a technology of choice for near-future secure quantum communications.</p>

									<p>We provide a security analysis for continuous variable quantum key distribution protocols based on the transmission of two-mode squeezed vacuum states measured via homodyne detection. We employ a version of the entropic uncertainty relation for smooth entropies to give a lower bound on the number of secret bits which can be extracted from a finite number of runs of the protocol. This bound is valid under general coherent attacks, and gives rise to keys which are composably secure. For comparison, we also give a lower bound valid under the assumption of collective attacks. For both scenarios, we find positive key rates using experimental parameters reachable today.</p>

									<p>We prove that Gaussian continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols, using a Gaussian distribution of coherent or squeezed states and homodyne or heterodyne measurement, are secure against arbitrary attacks.</p>
									<p>Our proof exploits the speciﬁc symmetries in phase-space of Gaussian QKD protocols to prove that once a simple test over the measurement outcomes succeeds, the global state shared between Alice and Bob is well decribed by assigning a low dimensional Hilbert space to each mode. Then one can use the postselection technique introduced by Christandl, Koenig and Renner for discrete-variable protocols to conclude.</p>
									<p>Our result greatly improves over previous ones using either a de Finetti theorem or an entropic uncertainty principle which could not be applied to prove the security of protocols in realistic experimental implementations.</p>
