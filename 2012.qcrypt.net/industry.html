				<h3 id="exhibits">Industry Exhibits</h3>
				<p>During the course of the conference we will have exhibits, accessible during breaks, presented by:</p>
				
				<div class="exhib">
					<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/SingleQuantumLogoIndustry.png" alt="Single Quantum Logo" /></p>
					<p><a href="http://www.singlequantum.com/">Single Quantum</a> provides superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs), which are sensitive to single photons from the UV to the near-infrared and have superior performance when it comes to quantum efficiency, time resolution, dark noise and dead time.</p>
					<p>We are the first company offering a complete closed cycle SNSPD with a built-in cryogenic cooler, which requires no liquid helium refills.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="exhib">
					<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/AITLogoIndustry.png" alt="Single Quantum Logo" /></p>
					<p><a href="http://www.ait.ac.at/">The AIT, Austrian Institute of Technology</a> takes a leading position in the Austrian innovation system and a key role in Europe as the research and technology organization focusing on the key infrastructure topics of the future. AIT provides research and technological development to realize basic innovations for the next generation of infrastructure related technologies in the fields of health & environment, energy, mobility and safety and security. These technological research areas are supplemented by the competence in foresight and policy development. As a national and international network node at the interface of science and industry, AIT enables innovation through its scientific-technological expertise, market experience, tight customer relationships and high quality research infrastructure.</p>
					<p>According to this mission, AIT is strategically positioned as a key player in the Austrian and European innovation system by performing applied research for and enabling the market exploitation of innovative infrastructure related solutions. This functionality of “bridging the gap between research and technology commercialization” is seen as a fundamental role for commercialization of new technologies and strengthening economic development.</p>
					<p>The Research Service “Optical Quantum Technology” is the only research unit worldwide which developed a quantum key distribution system based on entanglement. Based on the fundamental research of Anton Zeilinger at the University Vienna we could show the functional demonstration of this installation within the EU project SECOQC in 2008. In the meantime we offer “AIT QKD EPR-SYS-405” system as standard product. Our research is focused on the improvement of QKD systems as well as on the different building blocks. Thus we developed single photon detectors, time tagging modules, polarization control as well as specific algorithms for the QKD software stack.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="exhib">
					<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/IDQLogoIndustry.png" alt="Single Quantum Logo" /></p>
					<p><a href="http://www.idquantique.com/">ID Quantique</a> has a growing scientific instrumentation business, where the company's core Quantum Photonics technologies provide innovative solutions for industrial, commercial and research applications. Its product offering includes photon-counters based on avalanche photodiodes in Geiger mode for the visible and infrared regions of the optical spectrum. It also includes short-pulse laser sources and a time to digital converter. Beside the scientific instrumentation division, IDQ is also the leader in Quantum Cryptography for commercial and R&D application. Additionally IDQ also offers quantum random number generator and high-performance multi-protocol network encryption solutions.</p>

					<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/SeQureNetLogoIndustry.png" alt="SeQureNet Logo" /></p>
					<p><a href="http://www.sequrenet.fr/">SeQureNet</a> is a start-up company founded in 2008 as a spin-off from the Quantum Information team of Telecom ParisTech. The domain of expertise of SeQureNet’s team of scientists and engineers are network security, cryptography, quantum information and software development. The R&D work of SeQureNet is currently focused on the development of Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) technology.</p>
					<p>A French research project, SEQURE (2008-2011), resulted in a CVQKD demonstrator that worked continuously during several months on a 17Km link with 5.6dB losses; the resulting keys were used in Thales MISTRAL encryptors. That project involved Thales Research and Technologies, Thales Communications, Telecom Paristech and Institut d'Optique Graduate School; SeQureNet was in charge of the deployment of the demonstration and its maintenance.</p>
					<p>SeQureNet competed and won prizes in two French innovation competitions in 2007 and 2008. The company is involved in several collaborations with the leaders in the domain of QKD and particularly CVQKD: SeQureNet is a partner of an FP7 CHIST-ERA project, HIPERCOM, which also involves Telecom ParisTech, Institut d’Optique Graduate School, Université Libre de Bruxelles, University of York and Max-Planck Institute, and is focused on Continuous Variables Quantum Communications, including CVQKD; it participates with Telecom Paristech to a FP7 Marie-Curie IAPP Project, Q-CERT, which also involves both the academic and industrial leaders of DVQKD, namely the GAP group of the Université de Genève and IdQuantique. SeQureNet and Telecom ParisTech are also partners of an international research project, FREQUENCY, managed in France by Telecom ParisTech, which is built on collaborations with several Canadian research teams, at the universities of Montreal, Calgary and Waterloo. Finally, SeQureNet licensed from Thales a patent (EP1825633) covering the current optical scheme of CVQKD devices. This allowed SeQureNet to develop the first commercial CVQKD device, for which SeQureNet provides customization services for laboratory experiments. High-performance post-processing software (including multidimensional protocols enabling CVQKD at low SNRs, error-correction, privacy amplification) is available for experimentalists who focus on hardware development stability and want to extract secret keys from the raw data provided by their experiments.</p>
