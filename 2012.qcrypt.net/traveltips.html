				<h3 id="GettingAround">Getting around Singapore</h3>

				<h4>By public transportation</h4>
				<h5>Using Singapore Tourist Pass</h5>
				<p>You can explore Singapore via our public transport system with The Singapore Tourist Pass. The Singapore Tourist Pass offers unlimited rides on the MRT, LRT and basic bus services at just SGD 8 per day. You can purchase a one-day, two-day or three-day pass with a refundable SGD 10 deposit (the pass must be returned within five days). The pass also comes bundled with merchant offers, providing you with more benefits during your stay in Singapore. The Singapore Tourist Pass is sold at TransitLink ticket offices at the Singapore Changi Airport, Orchard, Chinatown, City Hall, Raffles Place, Ang Mo Kio, Harbour Front and Bugis MRT stations as well as at selected Singapore Visitors Centres. For more information, <a href="http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com/html/index.htm">visit TheSingaporeTouristPass.com</a>.</p>
				<p>Bus trips are less than SGD 3, while MRT rides cost around SGD 3 per trip. Signs are in English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay. Singapore Tourist Passes offer tourists unlimited travel on MRTs and public buses.</p>
				<ul><li>1-day Pass: SGD 18</li><li>2-day Pass: SGD 26</li><li>3-day Pass: SGD 34</li></ul>
				<p>**(Excludes SGD 10 refundable deposit if returned within 5 days of issuance.)</p>

				<h5>Using EZ-Link Card</h5>
				<p>The ez-link card was the very first contactless stored value card introduced for public transit use on the MRT, LRT and buses. With the ez-link card, there is no more fuss and hassle of paying with coins or verifying the correct fare to pay. It is just tap and go! Almost every Singaporean carries at least one ez-link card in his or her wallet not just for transit purposes but for all kinds of lifestyle payment needs such as ERP charges, shopping at retail outlets, dining, government services and so much more. Wherever you are in Singapore, you can get an ez-link card easily as there is an extensive network of sales points across the island including: 42 TransitLink Ticket Offices and 6 Concession Card Replacement Offices located at MRT stations and bus interchanges Passenger Service Centres within most MRT stations.</p>
				<p>At the above places, you can purchase an ez-link card at $12 out of which $7 is stored value for your use. The remaining $5 is the cost of the card which is non-refundable. For more information on both the MRT and bus services, <a href="http://www.publictransport.sg/publish/ptp/en.html">visit publictransport.sg</a>.</p>

				<h4>By Taxi</h4>
				<p>Taxis are very affordable in Singapore. You can get a taxi in many ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hailing one along a road (except roads in the Central Business District (CBD) with public buses plying);</li>
					<li>Queuing for one at a taxi-stand;</li>
					<li>Through telephone booking.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Taxis are not allowed to pick up or alight passengers along roads in the CBD where buses ply between 7am to 10pm from Monday to Saturday, other than a public holiday. They are required to do so at taxi stands/stops and driveways of buildings. During peak hours, there is a 35% surcharge, and a 50% surcharge after midnight. As taxis may not be readily available during the morning and evening peak periods (7 am to 9 am and 5 pm to 11 pm), you may wish to consider making a telephone booking for one. Taxi commuters can now make a taxi booking with just one number, 6-DIAL CAB (6342 5222). However, there may be times when the demand for taxi bookings is also exceedingly high.</p>
