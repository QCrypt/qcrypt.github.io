				<h3>Goal of the Conference</h3>
				<p>The Annual Conference on Quantum Cryptography (QCRYPT) is a conference for students and researchers working on all aspects of quantum cryptography. This includes theoretical and experimental research on the possibilities and limitations of secure communication and computation with quantum mechanical devices or in the presence of quantum mechanical devices. (The conference includes but is not limited to research on quantum key distribution.)</p>
				<p>It is the goal of the conference to represent the previous year's best results on quantum cryptography and to support the building of a research community in quantum cryptography. In order to achieve this goal, the conference will feature both invited and contributed talks, selected by the steering committee and programme committee, respectively. In line with this goal, the conference has no published proceedings. QCRYPT welcomes the submission of any interesting and important result, while allowing researchers from a wide range of disciplines to pursue publication in any appropriate venue.</p>
			
				<h3>Steering Committee</h3>
				<p>The Steering Committee (SC) is responsible for shaping the medium- and long-term course of the conference series and for making sure that the conferences maintain a high scientific and organisational standard. In particular, the SC has the responsibility to select the main organiser, venue and programme chair for the next conference. The SC has approximately 7 members and is chaired by the next conference's main organiser. The SC chair is responsible for the external relations of the conference.</p>
				<p>The first two conferences will take place at the ETH Zurich and CQT Singapore, and the organisers are prepared to continue organizing the conference alternately. This cycle may be expanded if proposals of high quality are received to host the conference. The conference takes place over one week (Monday to Friday) in August or September, although some flexibility may be permitted depending on local circumstances.</p>
				<p>The SC selects the invited speakers. At most half of the talk time of the conference can be given to invited speakers. The remaining talk time is reserved for contributed talks. SC members cannot be invited speakers, but are allowed to submit and present contributed papers.</p>
			
				<h3>Programme Committee</h3>
				<p>The role of the Programme Committee (PC) is to select the best submissions. The PC chair (selected by the SC), helped by advice from the SC, recruits the PC members, typically 10 or more people representing the broad range of subfields specified above. PC members are allowed to submit papers and to present contributed papers. PC members must declare a conflict of interest on submissions to which they contributed so that they are not involved in discussing these papers in the PC.</p>

				<h3>Advisory Committee</h3>
				<p>The Advisory Committee (AC) advises the SC on the long-term direction of the conference series. The AC has at most 10 members covering a broad range of geographical locations and scientific expertise. The advisory committee is regularly informed by the SC about the progress of the conference organisation and gives input on future decisions, for instance on invited speakers and sponsorship.</p>
