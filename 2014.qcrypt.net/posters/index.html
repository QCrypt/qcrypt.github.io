<div class="abstract" id="abst2b">Entangled states are important for quantum cryptography, being used in several protocols of quantum key distribution. These provide an alternative to single-photon-based protocols. Entangled states are also important in fundamental terms, in the way that the behavior of these states is contradictory with the predicted by local theories. This contradiction is shown by the violation of Bell’s inequalities, as the inequality proposed by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH). In this work we shown the violation of CHSH inequality using two-particle states. We discussed pure states, an arbitrary state, and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Using the spontaneous four-wave mixing process we generated entangled photon pairs in a highly non-linear fiber, and experimentally verified the violation of CHSH inequality.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst2">The ability to reduce proofs of quantum information processing tasks from any permutation in-variant state to a de-Finetti state, that is, a convex combination of i.i.d. states, is useful in several tasks, such as cryptographic quantum protocols and quantum tomography. It is thus interesting to see whether such de-Finetti type theorems are unique for quantum theory or can be proven for more general theories. We prove that this can indeed be done under the framework of conditional probability distributions. That is, a physical system is described by a conditional probability distribution PA|X where X denotes the possible measurements and A the possible outcomes. For such systems we prove a post selection theorem which states that any permutation invariant system PA|X can be post selected by a measurement of a de-Finetti type system with high enough probability. We use this theorem to simplify security proofs of non-signalling cryptographic protocols.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst3">In practical Quantum Key Distribution, there exist scenarios where the number of exchanged qubits is limited by physical constraints. A notable case is that of satellite QKD, where channel losses and visibility play a major role in limiting the efficiency and the availability of the quantum link. With this perspective in mind, the need for evaluating finite-key effects on the secret key rate is urgent.<br />
In this work, we experimentally evaluate, in a realistic setup and with different channel conditions, the robustness of a recent finite-key tight theoretical bound that ensures secrecy against the most general quantum attacks. We compare the experimental results obtained by this bound with the ones achieved with a new finite-key bound tailored for ensuring secrecy against individual attacks.<br />
We then show, the minimum number of raw bits to be exchanged in order to obtain a given secret key length, for different values of the QBER. This provides a valuable tool for practical QKD, as it allows to know in advance, depending on the channel noise, how may bits have to be exchanged for obtaining the desired secret key length.<br />
The results indicate that viable conditions for effective symmetric, and even one-time-pad, cryptography are achievable.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst5">Removing assumptions about devices and signals from quantum cryptography protocols is an important task. Often it is assumed that measurements are memoryless and each signal is measured independently. We aim to remove this assumption by considering a related problem involving what we call quantum exams: First assume a student has a quantum memory which has an encoding of a classical string. Consider that the student is asked to produce a small subset of the string (i.e. and exam), and then is asked for another subset of the string. If the student can make a good estimate in the first exam, he should be able to also make a good estimate in the second exam. We examine this problem in the case of a classical or quantum memory for the student, and its relation to quantum cryptography.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst9">Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is maturing quickly. However, the current approaches to its network use require conditions that make it an expensive technology. All the QKD networks deployed to date are designed as a collection of dedicated point-to-point links that use the trusted repeater paradigm. Instead, we propose a novel network model in which QKD systems use simultaneously quantum and classical signals that are wavelength multiplexed over a common communication infrastructure. Signals are transmitted end-to-end within a metropolitan area using passive components. The model resembles a commercial telecom network and takes advantage of existing components, thus allowing for a cost-effective and reliable deployment.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst11">Running single photon detectors (such as single photon avalanche photodiodes or superconducting nanowire detectors) at high speed is challenging and requires innovative driving and signal processing electronics. Self-differencing has been shown to be a very successful method to achieve detection rates in excess of 1 GHz using APDs while keeping low error rates from dark counts and afterpulses. Here, we present first results of high bit-rate QKD using a novel compact self-differencing setup which is integrated completely on a single printed circuit board (PCB). We achieve bit rates higher than 1 Mbit/s for a fibre distance of 50 km.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst11a">Practical and secure quantum communications must not depend on any physical assumptions on the employed devices and be able to cover long distances, preferably without a line-of-sight requirement. The violation of a Bell&#8217;s inequality offers a method to certify the security of the link. Energy-time entanglement-based quantum communications can fulfill all the practical requirements. Unfortunately the main configuration employed in many demonstrations suffers from a post-selection loophole, which can be used to break the security of the communication. Here we experimentally demonstrate for the first time a Bell violation with energy-time entangled photon pairs distributed over 1 km optical fibers, in a new &#8220;hug&#8221; interferometric configuration, which is free of the post-selection loophole. For the two-photon interference curves we obtain average raw and net visibilities of 84.4 and 95.1% respectively, with a corresponding violation of the Bell CHSH inequality of S = 2.39 for the raw results, surpassing the classical limit by 3.25 standard deviations. Our results indicate that quantum key distribution using energy-time entangled pairs free of the post-selection loophole is feasible over long-distances.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst12">Quantum Key Distribution has moved from its theoretical promises of unconditional security to rapidly approaching real world deployments. An important part of this has been the significant order of magnitude increases in the secure key bit rate seen over the last few years. However, these advances have almost all been confined to the physical hardware stage of QKD, with the following classical post-processing of the key required often unable to keep up with the high raw bit rates. In any real implementation this would lead to bottlenecks, limiting the actual bit rate of the system. Here we report details of a full software implementation of high speed error correction for QKD based on rate adaptable Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, which is not only able to operate at the full rate of a high speed QKD system but also reveals less information than current protocols, resulting in an increase in secure key rate.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst14">We study how to use quantum key distribution (QKD) in common optical network infrastructures and propose a method to overcome its distance limitations. QKD is the first technology offering information theoretic secret-key distribution that relies only on the fundamental principles of quantum physics. Point-to-point QKD devices have reached a mature industrial state; however, these devices are severely limited in distance, since signals at the quantum level (e.g. single photons) are highly affected by the losses in the communication channel and intermediate devices. To overcome this limitation, intermediate nodes (i.e. repeaters) are used. Both, quantum-regime and trusted, classical, repeaters have been proposed in the QKD literature, but only the latter can be implemented in practice. As a novelty, we propose here a new QKD network model based on the use of not fully trusted intermediate nodes, referred as weakly trusted repeaters. This approach forces the attacker to simultaneously break several paths to get access to the exchanged key, thus improving significantly the security of the network. We formalize the model using network codes and provide real scenarios that allow users to exchange secure keys over metropolitan optical networks using only passive components.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst17">A natural definition for a process to be truly random is that its outcome is not predictable from any information available before the process has been started. The advantage of using quantum systems for random number generation compared to classical approaches lies in the fact that the unpredictability of the randomness can be proven based on physical principles. In practice however, due to imperfections of the devices, the resulting raw randomness also depends on classical noise and therefore does not fulfil this definition either.<br />
Here we provide a framework for generating almost perfect true randomness using noisy devices by appropriate post-processing (hashing) of the raw randomness. Compared to previous work on random number generators (RNGs), we take this noise into account as side information, which is necessary to meet the above definition of true randomness. Our approach assumes that the process generating the raw randomness is correctly described by a quantum model. Compared to device- independent randomness expansion, this has the advantage of being practical (it is applicable to commercially available devices) and does not require pre-existing randomness. We stress, however, that our results do not rely on any completeness assumption regarding the model or quantum theory. We illustrate our proposal for a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) based on a beam splitter and show how the post-processing procedure used in some of the current devices can be improved.</div>

Specifically we target continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems that use the heterodyne detection protocol using either direct or reverse reconciliation.

Eve launches a bright optical pulse into Bob and analyses the back-reflections that arise from different components and interfaces in Bob. By homodyning the weak coherent state in a suitable back-reflected pulse with an appropriately delayed local oscillator, Eve can get information about Bob’s basis choice with high accuracy. Since the basis choice is essentially the raw secret key in SARG04 protocol, Eve could in principle know the whole key. However, a problem that needs to be circumvented is that of afterpulsing caused by the bright Trojan-horse pulses impinging on the avalanche photodiode based single-photon detectors in Bob. This increases the dark counts or false clicks, thus directly translating into a higher quantum bit error rate (QBER) that could expose Eve. Nonetheless, we show that there exist attack regimes that allow Eve to get a partial information of the key without being discovered, thus breaching the security of the QKD system.</div>

However, in practical systems, this assumption is invalid in some situations, then the security of decoy state method will be compromised. Actually, a wavelength-selected PNS (WSPNS) is proposed by our group to break the security of decoy state “plug-and-play” QKD systems by exploiting the imperfection of the intensity modulator (IM) that used to generate the signal state and decoy state.

Here, we propose and provide experimental evidence of an attack targeting the local oscillator calibration routine of a continuous-variable QKD system. The attack targets the classical local oscillator pulses during the QKD run in order to modify the trigger pulses used at the detection stage.

Experimentally, we investigated fiber channels up to a length of 40 km for a wide range of coherent state amplitudes.

<div class="abstract" id="abst30">Quantum communication (QC) is one of the most important branches of quantum information. It takes advantage of some basic principles in quantum mechanics to accomplish the task of transmitting secret message securely. This novel accomplishment of communication has great power for the development of information field. Since Bennett and Brassard published their first QKD scheme in 1984 (BB84), a great number of theoretic models have been proposed. Experiments have demonstrated the practical of QC and have a significant development. However, the photons taking the information are incident to be influenced by the noise of environment, such as thermal fluctuation and the imperfection of the fiber. It affects the efficiency and security of communication, and plenty of methods have been proposed to solve the noise problem in QC. The decoherence-free subspace (DFS) is one of the most available methods based on special noise conditions. Collective-rotation noise and collective-dephasing noise are two basic effect of environment and form the general noise. We present quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes over the two kinds of collective-noise channel based on the DFSs.<br />
In the QKD schemes, each logical qubit, composed of two physical qubits which are in states of decoherence-free subspaces, is immune to a collective noise and can carry one bit of information in theory. Although the receiver should prepare entangled two-photon quantum systems, he can read out the information encoded by the sender with two unitary operations on two photons, resorting to only two single-photon measurements, not Bell-state measurements, which makes these protocols simpler than others in experiment. These QKD protocols are deterministic, not random, which makes the classical information exchanged be reduced largely. Also, they have a high intrinsic efficiency.</div>

We compare this system with the case when both parties have an imperfect single-photon source. For this system we calculate the key rate versus the distance. Then, we combine MDI-QKD and QRs protocols, by introducing quantum memories (QMs) in the original MDI-QKD scheme. We, first, generate entangled states between the QMs using the protocol proposed by Sangouard et. al. in [Phys. Rev. A 76, 050301 (2007)]. We calculate the key rate of such a protocol versus the distance up to two nesting levels. We consider various sources of imperfection in both protocols, such as dark counts in detectors, and inefficiencies in the channel, photodetectors and memories.</div>

On one hand, the MDI-QKD is able to shield all practical attacks realized so far. We experimentally demonstrate the MDI-QKD protocol by implementing high-speed and low-noise up-conversion single photon detectors. The security of MDI-QKD relies on a trusted source scenario, where the decoy-state method is assumed. On the other hand, phase randomization is commonly ignored from the decoy-state method. We demonstrate a USD attack on a decoy-state QKD system when the phase randomization is ignored.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst38">To support the development of quantum cryptography technologies that utilize entangled photon pairs for operation, our research has focused on the development of sources and components that efficiently generate entangled photon pairs and couple them into optical fibers for routing. To generate entangled photon pairs, we have integrated optical waveguides into periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) chips and utilize spontaneous parametric down conversion. Currently, the coupling loss from the PPLN waveguide to the optical fiber is the dominant loss mechanism. To increase the probability that the entangled photon pairs are received in cryptographic systems, we have been exploring various optical designs to increase the coupling efficiency between waveguide and fiber. Similar approaches have been utilized in standard telecommunications applications to reduce optical coupling losses, but the impact of these configurations for entangled photon pair sources has not been studied previously. In order to benchmark coupling efficiency of entangled photon pairs, we constructed an experiment to measure both single photon counts and photon pair coincidence counts. The results of the entangled photon pair coincidence measurements as a function of optical coupling design will be presented, and the impact of these waveguide geometries on entanglement will be discussed.</div>

We remedy this situation by giving the first complete proof that when combined with a notion of correctness, it implies cryptographic (simulation-based) security for QKD.<br />
To do this, we first revisit the notion of simulatable security necessary for a general protocol to be usable in a larger cryptographic context, and derive the corresponding security criterion for QKD. We then prove that the known notions of secrecy and correctness are sufficient to achieve this security criterion. We also illustrate the composition of various protocols with QKD with several examples.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst43">Three network architectures, compatible with passive optical networks, for future hybrid quantum-classical networks are proposed and compared. These setups rely on three different schemes for quantum key distribution (QKD): BB84, entanglement-based QKD, and measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD). It turns out that, while for small-to-moderate-size networks BB84 supports the highest secret key generation rate, it may fail to support large numbers of users. Its cost implications are also expected to be higher than other setups. For large networks, MDI-QKD offers the highest key rate if fast single-photon detectors are employed. Entanglement-based networks offer the longest security distance among the three setups. MDI-QKD is, however, the only architecture resilient to detection loopholes and possibly the most favorable with its less demanding end-user technology.Entanglement-based and MDI-QKD setups can both be combined with quantum repeater systems to allow for long-distance QKD with no trust constraints on the service provider.</div>

We provide an analysis of Brassard&#8217;s BINARY and CASCADE IR protocols, two protocols commonly used in QKD. Using generating functions, we give an accurate result on BINARY. We derive the error probability distribution at each pass, which allows us to compute the decoding error probability and the number of &#8220;leaked&#8221; bits; two quantities crucial in the proof of security for QKD. We then corroborate the probability distribution computed by our formulas with actual simulation results. Finally we show that our formulas give better estimate for the decoding error probability of BINARY than the upper bound derived by Brassard for CASCADE. Because CASCADE should have better decoding performance than BINARY, this shows that Brassard&#8217;s estimate of CASCADE may be too loose and can be improved.

<div class="abstract" id="abst48">If two parties were to exploit today&#8217;s quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, they would be limited to being at most ~100 km apart [1]. It is possible to overcome this limit with a quantum repeater that exploits quantum memories for qubit synchronization [1]. Among other criteria desired for quantum memories, simultaneous storage of multiple qubits (multiplexing) and recall of any desired qubit on-demand is required for a quantum repeater [1,2]. These properties are generally associated with the ability to trigger the re-emission of any previously stored qubit at a desired time [3]. We will argue that this view is too restricted, and that it is possible to build a quantum repeater using quantum memories that allow storage of frequency multiplexed qubits supplemented with frequency-selective read-out on demand. Furthermore we report on measurements exploiting the atomic frequency comb protocol in a Ti:Tm:LiNbO3 waveguide cooled to 3 K [4,5] that shows the required on-demand readout with average fidelities of 0.95 ± 0.03 thereby significantly violating the maximum fidelity of 0.67 possible using a classical memory. Our demonstration constitutes an important step towards the development of a quantum repeater.<br />

This is particularly relevant when investigating QKD in a practical setting where the available resources are finite. Here, we employ recent results in classical information theory to show that information reconciliation imposes fundamental limitations on the amount of secret key that can be extracted in the finite key regime.

<div class="abstract" id="abst55">Reconciliation, one of classical parts in QKD protocol, aims to mitigate errors due to the distribution of quantum keys over a quantum channel. In this work, a rate-adaptive reconciliation plays a significant role to improve the efficiency by the mean of channel coding schemes. Specifically, several LDPC codes based on puncturing and shortening are adapted to the technique of Slepian-Wolf coding for varying possible cases of error rates in QKD system. This method actually utilizes knowledge of error rate by the estimation of Maximum-Likelihood parameter with respect to the syndrome information (not Blind protocol). It is then beneficial to avoid the waste of a relevant part of sifted key in the traditional channel estimation process. From the simulation results, the proposed scheme provides improvement in the reconciliation efficiency that significantly impacts on the achievable secret key generation rate responding to the high throughput for QKD applications.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst56">We demonstrate continuous variable Gaussian entanglement distillation using a measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier. Our scheme relies on a heterodyne detection scheme, followed by a classical non-deterministic post selection of the measurements. We demonstrate that we are able to extract a subset of data presenting a stronger entanglement than the original resource, and that we can recover entanglement after transmission loss.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst57">Reconciliation is an important step to correct errors in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). In QKD, after comparing basis, two legitimate parties possess two correlative keys which have some difference and they could obtain identical keys through reconciliation.<br />
In our paper, we present a new rate compatible reconciliation scheme based on Row Combining with Edge Variation (RCEV) Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes which could change code rate adaptively in noisy channel where error rate may changes with time. Our scheme is easy to implement and could get good efficiency compared to existing schemes. Meanwhile, due to the inherent structure we use, the new scheme not only save memory space remarkably but also simplify the decoder architecture and accelerate the decoding.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst58">We provide a simple and relatively direct information-theoretic security proof of the prepare-and-measure BB84 quantum key distribution protocol against collective attacks in the asymptotic limit that is able to handle the problem of arbitrary source and detector misalignments. Unlike the majority of generic security frameworks that have been proposed in the past decade, our proposed framework does not require that the protocol under consideration be cast into an equivalent entanglement-based form as part of the analysis. Rather, security is derived based on a characterisation of the fundamental limit on an eavesdropper&#8217;s ability to clone quantum states imposed by quantum physics that we introduce for this purpose. The keyrate we derive is similar to and in some cases an improvement over one derived by Maroy et. al. in [Phys. Rev. A 82, 032337], which is the only previous security analysis that considered the understudied problem of source and detector flaws in full generality &#8212; a problem that must necessarily be addressed in any true proof of unconditional security applicable to practical and realistic QKD implementations. The formulation of our security result in the language of information theory (we bound the Devetak-Winter expression for the keyrate) should hopefully lead to generalisation to a still needed full unconditional security proof in future work.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst61">Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is essentially a quantum mechanical phenomenon, which is a key part in quantum communication protocols and linear optical quantum computation, especially for measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution. The main challenge of the two-photon interference is to keep the indistinguishability of the two photons. This requirement becomes much more crucial on a large scale and even in free space, where both fluctuations and photon loss overwhelm the fragile interference phenomenon. Here we report a field test of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with one arm being a 220 m free-space path. Our experiment is a step towards long distance free-space measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution.</div>

For the QKD part, we put the emphasis on continuous operation with a wavelength multiplexed service channel for synchronization and distillation, efficient hardware real-time distillation, finite key security analysis and frugal authentication. For the secure high-speed encryption of large data volumes, we present a system able to multiplex up to ten 10 Gbit/s Ethernet inputs, pass the 100 Gbit/s data stream through authenticated encryption before transmitting it over an optical fiber to the decryptor. The cipher cores apply and frequently refresh the quantum keys delivered by the QKD system.</div>

<div class="abstract" id="abst62">We propose a quantum key distribution scheme that combines a biased basis choice with the decoy-state method. In this scheme, Alice sends all signal states in the Z basis and decoy states in the X and Z basis with certain probabilities, and Bob measures received pulses with optimal basis choice. This scheme simplifies the system and reduces the random number consumption. From the simulation result taking into account of statistical fluctuations, we find that in a typical experimental setup, the proposed scheme can increase the key rate by at least 45% comparing to the standard decoy-state scheme. In the postprocessing, we also apply a rigorous method to upper bound the phase error rate of the single-photon components of signal states.</div>
