A Quantum Money Solution to the Blockchain Scalability Problem Andrea Coladangelo (Caltech); Or Sattath (Ben-Gurion University) [abstract] Abstract: We put forward the idea that classical blockchains and smart contracts are potentially useful primitives not only for classical cryptography, but for quantum cryptography as well. Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool to enforce monetary incentives.</description></item><item><title>Akihisa Tomita</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/steering/akihisa_tomita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/steering/akihisa_tomita/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Alex Grilo</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/alex_grilo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/alex_grilo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>American Physical Society</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/gold/aps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/gold/aps/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Artur Ekert</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/advisory/artur_ekert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/advisory/artur_ekert/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Baidu</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/bronze/baidu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/bronze/baidu/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Break + Q&amp;A + networking</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/__break/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/__break/</guid><description>Lunch and Coffee is served over in our virtual Meet &amp;amp; Greet Room .

Many efforts have been made towards the goal of achieving longer-distance QKD. In long terms, quantum repeater-based quantum network may provide an ultimate solution; In short term, both theoretical and experimental progress are made to distribute secure keys in longer distance in practical situation.</description></item><item><title>Invited: Quantum key distribution with correlated sources (Chairs: Roger Colbeck and Li Qian)</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_pereira/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_pereira/</guid><description>Abstract: In theory, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security. In practice, however, it does not, due to the discrepancies between the assumptions used in the security proofs and the behaviour of the real apparatuses. Recent years have witnessed a tremendous effort to fill the gap, being the treatment of correlations among pulses a major elusive problem. Here, we close this gap by introducing a simple yet general method to prove the security of QKD with arbitrarily long range pulse correlations.</description></item><item><title>Invited: Quantum zero-knowledge from Locally Simulatable Proofs (Chair: Margarida Pereira)</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_grilo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_grilo/</guid><description>Abstract: On a zero-knowledge protocol, Alice proves the truth of some statement (e.g. graph is 3-colorable, graph isomorphism, etc.) to Bob in such a way that he does not learn anything else than the truth of the statement. As paradoxical as it may sound, there are several proposals for zero-knowledge protocols in the classical setting and they have far-reaching applications in cryptography. Recently, there has been some effort on proposing new zero-knowledge protocols for quantum statements, but a long-standing open question is the existence of simple &amp;ldquo;commit-and-open&amp;rdquo; protocols for such a task.</description></item><item><title>Invited: Security proofs for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (Chair: Frédéric Dupuis)</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_leverrier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_leverrier/</guid><description>Abstract: Continuous variables are attracting a lot of attention lately in the quantum cryptography community thanks to their good compatibility with telecom standards. In order to improve implementations, however, it appears fruitful to deviate from the original &amp;ldquo;all-Gaussian&amp;rdquo; protocols and to rely instead on encodings on discrete consellations of coherent states. While beneficial from an implementation viewpoint, this modification raises a number of difficulties when it comes to proving the security of the protocol.</description></item><item><title>Invited: Speeding-up QKD and downsizing QRNGs (Chair: Louis Salvail)</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_bussieres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/invited_bussieres/</guid><description>Abstract: In this talk I will first cover some of our recent QKD progress towards increasing the reach and key rate using superconducting nanowires single-photon detectors designed specifically to optimise these goals. In a second part I will present the principle behind ID Quantique’s QRNG chip, which is now deployed in mobiles phones.

Cold atomic ensembles are a very promising approach for quantum internet, featuring long coherence time and collectively enhanced interaction with single photons. The current central theme in this direction is to improve the performance of fundamental building blocks and to construct small-scale networks which go beyond state of the art.</description></item><item><title>IOP Publishing</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/silver/iop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/silver/iop/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ivan Damgård</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/advisory/ivan_damgard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/advisory/ivan_damgard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jan Czajkowski</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/jan_czajkowski/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/jan_czajkowski/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jana Sotáková</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/jana_sotakova/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/jana_sotakova/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jelle Don</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/jelle_don/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/org/jelle_don/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jian-Wei Pan</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/advisory/jian-wei_pan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/team/advisory/jian-wei_pan/</guid><description/></item><item><title>JIQT</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/silver/jiqt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/silver/jiqt/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lunch + Q&amp;A + networking</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/__lunch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/sessions/__lunch/</guid><description>Lunch and Coffee is served over in our virtual Meet &amp;amp; Greet Room .

It dates back to the first security proofs for the BB84 protocol by Mayers and by Shor and Preskill. Since then, it has gradually extended its applicability to other QKD protocols. Here the “phase” refers to an observable complementary to the “bit” forming the key.</description></item><item><title>University of Amsterdam</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/community/uva/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/partners/community/uva/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Venues</title><link>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/venue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/venue/</guid><description>Conference Venue QCrypt 2020 will take at Roeterseiland Campus of the University of Amsterdam, located in walking distance to the inner city center of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
