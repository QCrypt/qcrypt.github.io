Fortunately, the recently proposed twin-field quantum key distribution can overcome this limit. Here, we for the first time propose a twin-field QDS (TF-QDS) protocol and give a corresponding security analysis. It can not only possess the highest security among all existing QDS protocols, but also exhibit outstanding performance in terms of both signature rates and secure transmission distances. Therefore, our work represents another step towards practical implementation of QDSs.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11262 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2003.11262]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster007Zhang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=9><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Secure random number generation from parity symmetric radiations</div><div class=paper-authors>Toyohiro Tsurumaru (Mitsubishi Electric Corporation);

Of various types of RNG method, those using radiations from nuclear decays (radioactive RNG) has a relatively long history but their security has never been discussed rigorously in the literature.
In this paper and in reference [T. Tsurumaru, T. Sasaki, and I. Tsutsui, arXiv:1912.09124 [quant-ph]], we propose a new method of the radioactive RNG that admits a simple and rigorous proof of security.
The security proof is made possible here by exploiting the parity (space inversion) symmetry arising in the device, which has previously been unfocused but is generically available for a nuclide which decays by parity-conserving interactions.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09124 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1912.09124]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster009Tsurumaru.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Toyohiro Tsurumaru

Usually, this requires a quantum communication infrastructure to transfer quantum states between the user and the bank. This work combines the notion of classical verification -- introduced by Gavinsky (CCC 2012) -- with the notion of user-generated money -- introduced here -- to introduce Semi-Quantum Money, the first quantum money scheme to require only classical communication with the (entirely classical) bank. This work features constructions for both a public memory-dependent semi-quantum money scheme, based on the works of Zhandry and Coladangelo, and for a private memoryless semi-quantum money scheme, based on the notion of Noisy Trapdoor Claw Free Functions (NTCF) introduced by Brakerski et al. (FOCS 2018).
In terms of technique, our main contribution is a strong parallel repetition theorem for NTCF.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08889 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1908.08889]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster011Radian.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Roy Radian

The security of quantum key distribution in this case is proved only under the assumption that either the output of the sender side or the input to the receiver side are single-photon signals, which impose a restriction over the class of possible eavesdropping strategies. Here we present a security proof without such a restriction and, thus, solve this important problem and prove the security of quantum key distribution with detection-efficiency mismatch against general attacks. In particular, we propose an adaptation of the decoy state method to the case of detection-efficiency mismatch.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07809 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2004.07809]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster012Trushechkin.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Anton Trushechkin

For a periodic function $f$ these algorithms produce -- via some quantum embedding of $f$ -- a quantum superposition $\sum_x \ket{x}\ket{f(x)}$, which requires a certain amount of output qubits that represent $\ket{f(x)}$. We show that one can lower this amount to a single output qubit by hashing $f$ down to a single bit in an oracle setting.
Namely, we replace the embedding of $f$ in quantum period finding circuits by oracle access to several embeddings of hashed versions of $f$. We show that on expectation this modification only doubles the required amount of quantum measurements, while significantly reducing the total number of qubits. For example, for Simon's period finding algorithm in some $n$-bit function $f: \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n$ our hashing technique reduces the required output qubits from $n$ down to $1$, and therefore the total amount of qubits from $2n$ to $n+1$. We also show that Simon's algorithm admits real world applications with only $n+1$ qubits by giving a concrete realization of a hashed version of the cryptographic Even-Mansour construction.
Our oracle-based hashed version of the Ekerå-Håstad algorithm for factoring $n$-bit RSA reduces the required qubits from $(\frac 3 2 + o(1))n$ down to $(\frac 1 2 + o(1))n$. In principle our hashing approach also works for the Mosca-Ekert algorithm, but requires strong properties of the hash function family. A hashed version of Mosca-Ekert with as few as $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits would imply classical polynomial time factoring.

Until now, quantum one-way functions have several input-output categories such as `classical-to-classical', `classical-to-quantum' and `quantum-to-classical', which are used for post-quantum cryptography or quantum cryptography. However, there are still no intrinsic `quantum-to-quantum' quantum one-way functions. In this paper, we propose the full quantum one-way function to design full quantum cryptographic schemes. By concatenating the `quantum-classical' one-way function and the rotation operation of a single qubit, the full quantum one-way function has the input and output of quantum states. We prove its one-way property from `easy computation' and `computationally difficult to invert'. Then we apply the full quantum one-way function to quantum identity authentication. Security analysis shows that the proposed quantum identity authentication scheme based on the full quantum one-way function is secure even under active attacks.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster022Tang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Tao Shang, Yao Tang

In this paper, we define a quantum point function and construct its obfuscation, then demonstrate the validity of applying quantum point obfuscation to quantum symmetric encryption scheme. We rigorously prove that IND-secure quantum symmetric encryption can be realized by quantum point obfuscators. Furthermore, with the properties of combinability or auxiliary inputs, a quantum point obfuscator can implement IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack)-secure quantum symmetric encryption or leakage-resilient quantum symmetric encryption, respectively. This work presents new usage of a quantum obfuscator and will complement the theory of quantum obfuscation.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster023Zhang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=24><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>The Improvement of Security for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Imperfect Phase Modulation</div><div class=paper-authors>Zhengwen Cao (School of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University Xi’an, 710127, China);

Similar to bills of paper money, most quantum money schemes assign a unique serial number to each money state, thus potentially compromising the privacy of the users of quantum money. However in a quantum coins scheme, just like the traditional currency coin scheme, all the money states are exact copies of each other, providing a better level of privacy for the users.
A quantum money scheme can be private, i.e., only the bank can verify the money states, or public, meaning anyone can verify. In this work, we propose a way to lift any private quantum coin scheme -- which is known to exist based on the existence of one-way functions, due to Ji, Liu, and Song (CRYPTO'18) -- to a scheme that closely resembles a public quantum coin scheme. Verification of a new coin is done by comparing it to the coins the user already possesses, by using a projector on to the symmetric subspace. No public coin scheme was known prior to this work. It is also the first construction that is very close to a public quantum money scheme and is provably secure based on standard assumptions. The lifting technique when instantiated with the private quantum coins scheme, due to Mosca and Stebila 2010, gives rise to the first construction that is very close to an inefficient unconditionally secure public quantum money scheme.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12438 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.12438]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster034Behera.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Amit Behera

Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) takes PIR further by additionally offering database privacy, where the user cannot learn any additional entries of the database. Unconditionally secure SPIR solutions with multiple databases are known classically, but are unrealistic because they require long shared secret keys between the parties for secure communication and shared randomness in the protocol. Here, we propose using quantum key distribution (QKD) instead for a practical implementation, which can realise both the secure communication and shared randomness requirements. We prove that QKD maintains the security of the SPIR protocol and that it is also secure against any external eavesdropper. We also show how such a classical-quantum system could be implemented practically, using the example of a two-database SPIR protocol with keys generated by measurement device-independent QKD. Through key rate calculations, we show that such an implementation is feasible at the metropolitan level with current QKD technology.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13921 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2004.13921]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster039Kon.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Wen Yu Kon

For this purpose, we developed a basic QKD testbed comprising a triggered solid-state single-photon source and a receiver module designed for four-state polarization coding via the BB84 protocol. Exploiting temporal filtering of the signal acceptance time window in a two-dimensional parameter space we analyze the sifted key fraction and the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) expected in in full implementations of QKD.

This is achieved by correlating the photon flux recorded at the four ports of our receiver.

Such an amount of power may modify the characteristics of components in a source. In this work, we study possible components to protect the source from the light-injected attacks, i.e., Trojan-horse attack, the laser-seeding attack, and the laser-damage attack. Experimental testing shows that fiber-optics isolators and circulators are good passive countermeasures because they sacrifice themselves' isolation under a high-power laser to protect other components behind them. Moreover, we find that illuminated by the high-power laser, integrated photonics QKD chips only lose the transmission of the coupler before any other change happens for the other components in the chips.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster043Huang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Anqi Huang

entanglement generation resource controlled by a possibly dishonest party. The test
consists only in local quantum operations and authenticated classical communication
once a state is shared among them and provides composable security, namely it can be
used as a secure subroutine by n honest parties within larger communication protocols
to test if a source is sharing quantum states that are at least Ɛ-close to the GHZ state.
This claim comes on top of previous results on multipartite entanglement verification
where the security was studied in the usual game-based model. Here, we improve the
protocol to make it more suitable for practical use in a quantum network and we study
its security in the Abstract Cryptography framework to highlight composability issues
and avoid hidden assumptions. This framework is a top-to-bottom theory that makes
explicit any piece of information that each component (party or resource) gets at every
time-step of the protocol. Moreover any security proof, which amounts to showing
indistinguishability between an ideal resource having the desired security properties (up
to local simulation) and the concrete resource representing the protocol, is composable
for free in this setting. This allows us to readily compose our basic protocol in order to
create a composably secure multi-round protocol enabling honest parties to obtain a
state close to a GHZ state or an abort signal, even in the presence of a noisy or malicious
source. Our protocol can typically be used as a subroutine in a Quantum Internet, to
securely share a GHZ state among the network before performing a communication or

In this work, we propose an efficient technique called double-decoy method which can provide relevant partial information of the input-output photon-number distribution, including the fraction of events in which the unknown quantum channel accepts and outputs a single photon. These detections correspond to events in which the transmitted single photon survives a basis-independent filter just before the measurement. We apply the double-decoy method to quantum key distribution (QKD) and show that it can substantially reduce the background noise and systematic error at the privacy amplification level, thereby improving the current secret key rate and achievable distance for standard QKD protocols.

Most of these applications such as delegated quantum computation require running a secure identification protocol between a low-resource and a high-resource party to provide secure communication. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been shown as resource-efficient hardware solutions for providing secure identification schemes in both classical and quantum settings. In this work, we propose two identification protocols based on quantum PUFs (qPUFs) as defined recently by Arapinis et al.
In the first protocol, the low-resource party wishes to prove its identity to the high-resource party and in the second protocol, it is vice versa. Unlike existing identification protocols based on Quantum Read-out of PUFs which rely on the security against a specific family of attacks, our protocols provide provable exponential security against any Quantum Polynomial-Time adversary with only polynomial resource parties. We provide a comprehensive comparison between the two proposed protocols in terms of resources such as quantum memory and computing ability required in both parties as well as the communication overhead between them. A stand-out feature of our second protocol is secure identification of a high-resource party by running a purely classical verification algorithm. This is achieved by delegating quantum operations to the high-resource party and utilising the resulting classical outcomes for identification.
An interesting application idea that emerges from our second protocol is certification or benchmarking of general quantum computation schemes based on purely running a classical test on the resulting measurement outcomes.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04522 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2006.04522]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster072Doosti-Delavar.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Mina Doosti, Mahshid Delavar, Niraj Kumar

Device-independent quantum random number generators (QRNGs) provide a means of completely trusted randomness, but are highly impractical due to their strict technological requirements, such as loophole-free quantum nonlocality.
By making fixed assumptions on specific parts of the device, semi-device-independent QRNGs lower these requirements drastically.
However, this {has usually been} done at the cost of limiting their flexibility and security to a specific physical implementation and level of trust.
Here we propose and experimentally test a new framework for semi-device-independent randomness certification that employs a flexible set of assumptions, allowing it to be applied in a range of physical scenarios involving both quantum and classical entropy sources.
At the heart of our method lies a source of trusted vacuum in the form of a signal shutter, which enables the honesty of partially trusted measurement devices to be tested and provides lower bounds on the guessing probability of their measurement outcomes.
We experimentally verify our protocol with a photonic setup and generate secure random bits under three different source assumptions with varying degrees of security and resulting data rates.
Our work demonstrates a simple and practical way for achieving semi-device-independent randomness generation with user-defined flexibility in terms of levels of trust and physical implementations.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12295 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.12295]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster075Pivoluska.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Matej Pivoluska

In some security demanding contexts, the perfect confidentiality that can be obtained with QKD combined with One-Time-Pad, may be insufficient. This will be in particular the case if the mere existence of communication can divulge crucial information. Performing QKD covertly solves this by insuring low probability of detection for the QKD signal states.
We study here for the first time Covert continuous variable (CV) QKD. We establish, in the general case of a thermal noise channel, that the covertness conditions impose drastic limits to the performance of such protocols. We then propose an original solution to overcome this limitation by performing a computationally-secure coherent block encoding, analogous to spread spectrum, to the signal pulses of a Gaussian modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol.
The resulting protocol provides covertness, under computational assumptions while preserving the information-theoretical security on the final QKD key. We show that our method enables QKD over realistic WDM environments such as a 30 km optical backbone populated by 25 standard channels.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster078Aymeric.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Raphaël AYMERIC

Another intuition is that enforcing measurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from these attacks.
However, the reality is much more complex. The security models dealing with superposition attacks only consider unconditional security. The first seminal papers date back to 1997 and prove the impossibility of unconditionally-secure bit-commitment schemes. Follow-up works heavily rely on this assumption of unconditional security to prove strong impossibility
results and their proof techniques cannot be applied to the computational setting. They essentially indicate that ideal primitives should in fact measure the input state. On the opposite, security models considering computational security assume that all supposedly classical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of superposition attacks.
To fill in the gap between those models, Boneh and Zhandry have started to study the quantum computational security for classical primitives in their seminal work at Crypto'13, but only in the single-party setting. To the best of our knowledge, an equivalent model in the multiparty setting is still missing.
In this work, we propose the first computational security model considering superposition attacks for multiparty protocols. We show that our new security model is satisfiable by proving the security of the well-known One-Time-Pad protocol and show an attack on a variant of the equally reputable Yao Protocol for Secure Two-Party Computations. The post-mortem of this attack reveals the precise points of failure, yielding highly counter-intuitive results: The attack vector consists of a (classically) seemingly inoffensive message and a measurement performed by the honest player. This example shows that adding extra classical communication, which is harmless for classical security, can make the protocol become subject to superposition attacks.
Our results show that intuitions can be misleading when reasoning about cryptographic protocols in a quantum world, and that there is no evident answer to provide for either the vulnerabilities of classical protocols to superposition attacks or the adapted countermeasures.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00677 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2007.00677]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster084Music.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Luka Music

Motivated by this, in this work we revisit the formal security of the core of the Bitcoin protocol, called the Bitcoin backbone, in the presence of an adversary that has access to a scalable quantum computer.

These operations consist of a direct measurements on the devices followed by Local Operations and Public Communication (MDLOPC). We formulate a security condition for the considered class of protocols, that is based on the newly introduced non-signaling norm. This norm takes supremum over certain operations, that can be used to discriminate devices. It is shown that the security condition based on this norm, is equivalent to two security conditions present in the literature. We employ the idea of ``squashing" on the secrecy monotones, which provide upper bounds on the key rate in secret key agreement (SKA) scenario, and show that squashed secrecy monotones are the upper bounds on NSDI key. As an important instance, an upper bound on NSDI key rate called ``squashed non-locality", has been constructed. It exhibits several important properties, including convexity, monotonicity, and additivity on tensor products. Using this bound, we identify numerically a domain of two binary inputs and two binary outputs non-local devices for which the squashed non-locality is zero. Therefore one can not distill key from them via MDLOPC operations. These are mixtures of Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) and anti-PR box with the weight of PR less than 80%. This example confirms the intuition that non-locality need not imply secrecy in the non-signaling scenario. The approach is general, describing how to construct other tighter yet possibly less computable upper bounds. Our technique for obtaining upper bounds is based on the non-signaling analog of quantum purification: the complete extension. This extension provides the ultimate eavesdropping power with the minimal consumption of eavesdropper's memory and, as we prove, yields equivalent security conditions as previously known in the literature.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf>[no PDF yet]</div></div></li><li value=102><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Ultrafast and practical Bell-based quantum randomness generation with classical optical homodyne detection</div><div class=paper-authors>Chao Wang (Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore);

Due to the possibility of free space communication, in general, the application candidates of free space QKD are focused on secure communication between moving terminals. Such applications have characteristics such as moving position, outside operation, and limited internal space and power consumption. First, the moving position of a terminal needs active compensation of a shared reference between transmitter and receiver because general QKD protocols requires a shared reference frame, i.e., polarization reference in a QKD protocol using polarization encoding. This can be solved by using reference frame independent (RFI) QKD. Second, the outside operation brings intensive noise issue caused by the sun light which significantly degrades the performance of free-space QKD. The change of operating wavelength of QKD to 1550-nm and single mode fiber coupling can significantly alleviate the noise issue. Finally, the limitation of internal space requires to chip scale implementation. The use of 1550-nm wavelength provides comparability of integrated (silicon) photonic chips which is already studied in the fiber based QKD.
In this paper, we provide a 1550-nm free-space RFI QKD system which incorporates the aforementioned solutions while the previous free-space RFI QKD is realized with visible wavelength. We also shows that our system achieves about 0.8% quantum bit error rate (QBER) without additional blocking out external light to the receiver through single mode fiber coupling. This low QBER indicates the possibility of daylight free-space QKD.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster118Lim.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Kyongchun Lim

Most of the free-space QKD systems require integration of various signals such as quantum and beam tracking channels with different wavelengths into the same optical path for beam tracking. The beam tracking system, consisting of fast steering mirrors and position detectors, maintains optical beam path by adjusting the misalignments induced by moving terminals, vibrations and atmospheric turbulence in the free-space QKD system. Most QKD systems use dichroic mirrors for combining and separating quantum and beam tracking channels through free-space alignment. However, integration of such channels in free-space could require a large volume space, much alignment effort for mode overlap and can be easily affected by mechanical shock.
In this paper, we report the effect of using a fiber-based wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter for integrating the quantum and beam tracking channels in free-space QKD systems. A custom-made WDM filter was used in the transmitter part of the free-space BB84 QKD system, combining a 785 nm signal for quantum channel and a 1550 nm signal for beam tracking channel. HI780 fiber was selected for common output port of the device to maintain the orthogonality of polarization states and beam quality of the quantum channel. Although 1550 nm signal can suffer from the insertion and bending loss caused by smaller core size of the HI780 fiber, we could reduce the loss as low as 1.4 dB by designing the fiber with length within about 15 cm, well straightened. We could also obtain good beam quality and mode overlap of the quantum and beam tracking channels by using the common output port of the WDM filter.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster126Kim.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Minchul Kim

A narrow detector cross-section, such as with fibre coupling to a telescope, reduces the field of view (FOV) and thus increases the loss due to atmospheric turbulence. A larger detector cross-section increases the FOV; however, the corresponding increase in background noise also increases the QBER associated with a Discrete Variable (DV) QKD system. On the contrary, Continuous Variable (CV) QKD systems are highly tolerant to background noise, but their performance is still limited by the channel loss. The FOV of the receiver is defined as the area expressed in solid angle from which the detector can accepts signal. A simple geometrical analysis reveals FOV as $\Theta = 2\tan^{-1}(d/2F)$, where $d$ is the detector diameter and $F$ is the effective focal length of the receiver telescope. With a large-area detector, one can design the signal collection optics, such that the FOV of the telescope with a given aperture can be larger. In this work, we present a larger FOV receiver system for CVQKD which reduces the channel loss due to beam wandering and atmospheric turbulence. We will describe the performance of the receiver system in terms of shot-noise sensitivity, loss reduction and enhancement in secure key rate, compared to a typical fibre-coupled receiver system.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster127Konieczniak.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Igor Konieczniak

After the proposal of the original protocol, multiple papers have extended the protocol to prove its security. However, these works are limited to the case where the two channels have equal amount of loss (i.e. are symmetric). In a practical network setting, it is very likely that the channels are asymmetric due to e.g. geographical locations. In this work we extend a version of the TF-QKD protocol to the scenario with asymmetric channels. We show that by simply adjusting the two signal states of the two users (and not necessarily the decoy states) they can effectively compensate for channel asymmetry and consistently obtain higher key rate than either using no compensation or using the strategy of deliberately adding fibre to the shorter channel. We perform simulation with realistic parameters and finite data size, and show that our method works well and has a clear advantage over prior art methods in the presence of channel asymmetry.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster140Wang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Wenyuan Wang

Continuous variable (CV) QKD that uses the coherent states and homodyne detection can only apply the cost-effective telecommunication components[1]. The field test of CV-QKD has reached over 50 km[2], and under the laboratory conditions, experimental demonstration of over 200km has been reported [3], thus, has revealed great potentials in practical implementations. The access network that allows multitude end-users to connect to the nodal network is a necessary in the modern network infrastructure since it is suitable for general home-to-home scenarios. Quantum access network was first proposed [4] and demonstrated in field tests [5] for discrete variable QKD. Here, we report an upstream access network based on CV-QKD. In our experimental demonstrations, two transmitters Alice are deployed as optical network units that simultaneously send signals to the network, the receiver Bob is acted as the optical line terminal. The optical distribution network is located between the optical network units and the optical line terminal to couple the signals. The signals generated from each optical network unit are required to pass through a variable delay line to calibrate the arriving time at the optical distribution network before being transmitted. The signals are then simultaneously sent to the optical distribution network through fibers of 5.3 km and 12.3 km respectively. When the signals approach to the optical distribution network, dynamic polarization control modules are firstly applied in each path to pre-compensate the polarization. The signals are then coupled through a beamsplitter and forwarded to the optical line terminal. With a system repetition frequency of 2.5 MHz, we obtain the averaged secret key rates of 55 kbps and 22 kbps for Alice No. 1 and Alice No. 2 respectively. The total secret key rates has reached 77 kbps which suggests a higher network capacity. The excess noise is relatively stable, yet there are small fluctuations in the secret key rates. To one step further reduce the loss, the wavelength division multiplexing devices can be used at the optical distribution network. This is especially beneficial when the quantum signal has to co-propagate with classical data channels in the same fiber [6,7]. The upstream access network implementations can be easily extended to a higher repetition frequency system or to support more users. The demonstration experiments provide the possibility of building practical large-scale CV-QKD networks.

The polarization mixing and relative phase can be estimated simultaneously by using the transmitted reference data and the corresponding detection data to calculate a overall rotation matrix, and compensated by rotating Bob's received data.
