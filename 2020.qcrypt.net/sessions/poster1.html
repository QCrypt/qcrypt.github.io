In this paper, we show that multipartite private states from which secret keys are directly accessible to trusted partners are genuinely multipartite entangled states. With application to secure Quantum Internet, we consider the most general setup of multipartite quantum process (channel) in a network setting: multiplex quantum channel with involved parties having one of the three possible roles-- that of only sender or receiver, or both sender and receiver. We derive divergence-based measures for entangling abilities of multipartite quantum channels. We describe an LOCC-assisted secret key agreement (SKA) protocol for generation or distillation of key (private random bits) among multiple trusted allies connected through a quantum multiplex channel secure against a quantum eavesdropper, of which measurement-device-independent QKD and SKA protocols over quantum network laced with key repeaters are particular instances. We are able to provide upper bounds on the non-asymptotic private capacities, maximum rate at which secret key can be distilled via finite uses of channels, and lower bounds on asymptotic capacities. These bounds are expressed in terms of the divergence-based entanglement measures of the channels. Some of these measures lead to strong converse bounds on the private capacities. Our upper bounds on the private capacities also are upper bound on the multipartite quantum capacities where goal is to distill Greenberger{Horne{Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Also, we are able to derive upper bound on the secret key bits that can be distilled via LOCC among trusted allies sharing finite copies of multipartite quantum states.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03646 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1912.03646]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster004Das.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=8><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Security of QKD with weak basis-choice flaw</div><div class=paper-authors>Shihai Sun (School of Physics and Astronomy, Sun Yat-Sen University);

security of QKD with weak basis-choice flaw, in which the random bit used by
Alice and Bob to determine their bases are weakly controlled by Eve. In fact, a
tight and analytical bound is obtained to estimate the phase error for both
single photon source and weak coherent source, then the key rate can be rapidly
improved. And the key rate of QKD with biased bases is also considered, in
which Alice and Bob distill key from two bases independently. Furthermore, by
evaluating the security of QKD under wavelength attack, the
performance of a commercial beam splitter is measured, and then the key rate is
estimated, which is just slightly reduced with our method.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster008Sun.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Shihai Sun</div></div></li><li value=14><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Noisy Simon Period Finding</div><div class=paper-authors>Alex May (Ruhr University Bochum);

It is well-known that Simon's algorithm finds $\vec s$ in time polynomial in $n$ on quantum devices that are capable of performing error-correction. However, today's quantum devices are inherently noisy, too limited for error correction, and Simon's algorithm is not error-tolerant.
We show that even noisy quantum period finding computations lead to speedups in comparison to purely classical computations. More precisely, we implemented Simon's quantum period finding circuit on the $15$-qubit quantum device IBM Q 16 Melbourne. Our experiments show that with a certain probability $\tau(n)$ we measure erroneous vectors that are not orthogonal to $\vec s$. We propose new, simple, but very effective smoothing techniques to classically mitigate physical noise effects such as e.g. IBM Q's bias towards the $0$-qubit.
After smoothing, our noisy quantum device provides us a statistical distribution that we can easily transform into an LPN instance with parameters $n$ and $\tau(n)$. Hence, in the noisy case we may not hope to find periods in time polynomial in $n$. However, we still obtain quantum advantage even for large errors $\tau(n)$ close to $\frac 1 2$. Thus, period finding does not necessarily require full quantum error correction capability.

A pressing and necessary issue for the design of quantum network protocols is the quantification of the rates at which these tasks can be performed. Here, we propose a simple recipe that yields efficiently computable lower and upper bounds on the maximum achievable rates. For this we make use of the max-flow min-cut theorem and its generalization to multi-commodity flows to obtain linear programs. We exemplify our recipe deriving the linear programs for bipartite settings, settings where multiple pairs of users obtain entanglement in parallel as well as multipartite settings, covering almost all known situations. We also make use of a generalization of the concept of paths between user pairs in a network to Steiner trees spanning a group of users wishing to establish Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03120 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1809.03120]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster015Baeuml.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=37><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Experimental semi-quantum key distribution with classical users</div><div class=paper-authors>F.

A natural question, therefore, is can users' technological requirements be reduced?

Practical quantum random number generators (QRNG) usually need to trust their devices, but their security can be jeopardized in case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work, we present a robust implementation of a Semi-Device-Independent QRNG that guarantees both security and fast generation rates.
The system works in a prepare and measure scenario where measurement and source are untrusted, but a bound on the energy of the prepared states is assumed. Our implementation exploits heterodyne detection, which offers increased generation rate and improved long-term stability compared to alternative measurement strategies. In particular, due to the tomographic properties of heterodyne measurement, we can compensate for fast phase fluctuations via post-processing, avoiding complex active phase stabilization systems. As a result, our scheme combines high security and speed with a simple setup featuring only commercial-off-the-shelf components, making it an attractive solution in many practical scenarios.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster045Tebyanian.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=48><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Security analysis of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution</div><div class=paper-authors>Jie Lin (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo);

A vast number of applications critically rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers that are generated securely. In this work we introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework, named \emph{incoherent randomness extraction} (IRE), in the context of quantum coherence theory where free incoherent operations are employed. This cryptographic framework unveils a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence distillation (QCD) by an \emph{exact} one-shot connection, that is, the maximum number of secure random bits extractable from a single instance of \emph{unstructured} quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum number of coherent bits that can be distilled from the same state. This exact relation not only sharpens our understanding on the operational equivalence between randomness and coherence, but also enables us to derive tight second order expansions (estimation of the number of extractable random bits/distillable coherent bits to the order~$o(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of the prepared source states) of both tasks in the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states all lead to the same second order expansions, indicating their operational equivalence for QCD as well as IRE in both asymptotic and large block length regimes. As a by-product, we showcase a proof of the strong converse property for IRE from its second order expansion, excluding a possible tradeoff between the insecurity threshold and the rate of extractable randomness of a protocol. This also contributes to an alternative strong converse proof for QCD due to their exact one-shot correspondence.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12004 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.12004]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster051Fang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Kun Fang</div></div></li><li value=60><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Nonlocal games, synchronous correlations, and Bell inequalities</div><div class=paper-authors>Nishant Rodrigues (University of Maryland);

Here, we first provide an efficient algorithm for completely characterizing the behaviour of a large class of repeater chain protocols. The algorithm determines the fidelity and generation time (waiting time) of the first generated entangled pair between the end nodes of a quantum repeater chain. It has polynomial runtime in the size of the support of the waiting time probability distribution. This runtime improves upon the exponential runtime of existing algorithms and allows us to analyze repeater chains of thousands of segments for some parameter regimes. Second, we use the algorithm for optimizing the achievable secret key rate. For this, we consider a family of repeater schemes generalizing the BDCZ scheme. In particular, the schemes incorporate a cut-off condition that enables to mitigate the effects of decoherence. We find that the use of the optimal cut-off extends the parameter regime for which secret key can be generated and moreover significantly increases the secret-key rate for a large range of parameters.

We propose an explicit d-dimensional key distribution protocol, that we call MUB-Quantum Computational Timelock (MUB-QCT) where one bit is encoded on a qudit state chosen among d + 1 mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Short-term-secure encryption is used to share the basis information with legitimate users while keeping it unknown from Eve until after her quantum memory decoheres. This allows to reduce Eve’s optimal attack to an immediate measurement followed by post-measurement decoding.
We demonstrate that MUB-QCT enables everlasting secure key distribution with input states containing up to O(\sqrt{d})photons. This leads to a series of important improvements when compared to QKD: on the functional side, the ability to operate securely between one sender and many receivers, whose implementation can moreover be untrusted ; significant performance increase, characterized by a O(\sqrt{d}) multiplication of key rates and an extension by 25km x log(d) of the attainable distance over fiber.

On the first level we use a continuous variable GKP code which encodes the qubit in a single bosonic mode. On the second level we use a small discrete variable code, encoding a logical qubit in as few as seven physical qubits. Such an architecture introduces two major novelties which allow us to make efficient use of resources. Firstly, our architecture makes use of two types of quantum repeaters: the simpler GKP repeaters that need to only be able to store and correct errors on a single GKP qubit and more powerful but more costly multi-qubit repeaters that additionally can correct errors on the higher level. We find that the combination of using the two types of repeaters enables us to achieve performance needed in practical scenarios with a significantly reduced cost with respect to an architecture based solely on multiqubit repeaters. Secondly the use of continuous variable GKP code on the lower level has the advantage of providing us with the information about the success probability of the specific GKP correction round. This analog information, unique to bosonic codes, provides significant boost in performance when used to correct second level errors in the multi-qubit repeaters.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster096Rozpedek.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Filip Rozpedek</div></div></li><li value=101><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Entanglement generation in a quantum network at distance-independent rates</div><div class=paper-authors>Ashlesha Patil (College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA);

However, achieving this task over global distances (thousands of km) is very daunting, due to the exponential losses of light in optical fibres.
The concept of a quantum repeater has been introduced to counter this problem. Such a device allows, using quantum memories and protocols based on entanglement swapping or quantum error correction, to connect several elementary links and enlarge the achievable distance.
An alternative solution is represented by satellite-relayed free-space channels, that have already been proven to be feasible with current technology. Using a double downlink from a single satellite, however, the maximum distance between the ground stations is limited to {1500-2000} km, due to the additional losses encountered at low elevation angles. Through quantum repeaters, few of these satellite links can be chained together to reach global distances. In this work we propose and study a scheme in which entanglement sources and quantum repeaters are placed on board of satellites, orbiting around the Earth in the string of pearls configuration. This allows to connect two users on the ground via free-space optical links outside the atmosphere, achieving far superior distance-to-loss ratio with respect to the standard fibre-based implementation. In this way, a small number of intermediate nodes is enough to achieve entanglement distribution over global distances at a reasonable rate.
The performance of this repeater chain is assessed in terms of the secret key rate achievable by the BB-84 cryptographic protocol, taking into account the most important sources of noise. We perform a comparison with other repeater chain architectures and show that our scheme is superior in almost every situation, achieving higher key rates, reliability and flexibility. These results have been obtained assuming reasonably conservative values of the parameters of the setup, such as the size of the optical elements and the efficiency of the quantum memories.
The feasibility of the implementation in the mid-term future is analysed, based on recent developments in space-borne technology. We finally discuss some exemplary orbital configurations to connect several pairs of cities around the world with very small satellite constellations and estimate the cost of such an infrastructure.
The integration of satellite-based links with ground repeater networks can be envisaged to represent the backbone of the future Quantum Internet.

As a result, there is interest in creating uncounterfeitable quantum money, in which a set of qubits can be spent as money but cannot be duplicated. To function as money, there must be a way to verify that a given state is a valid banknote and not a counterfeit. Many recent efforts have tried to allow public key verification, where any untrusted user, even a would-be counterfeiter, can verify the banknotes. However, despite many attempts, a secure construction of public-key quantum money has remained elusive.
Here we introduce franchised quantum money, a new notion that is weaker than public key quantum money but brings us closer to realizing it. Franchised quantum money allows any untrusted user to verify banknotes using a unique secret key. Furthermore, we give a construction of franchised quantum money and prove security assuming the quantum hardness of the short-integer solution problem (SIS). This is the first construction of quantum money that allows an untrusted user to verify the banknotes, and which has a proof of security based on widespread assumptions. It is therefore an important step toward public key quantum money.
Under franchised quantum money, untrusted users receive unique secret verification keys. With their key, a user can verify banknotes without the mint involved, but they cannot create counterfeit money that would fool another user. This is different from public key quantum money because the verification key may actually enable counterfeiting, but the only person that the counterfeiter can fool is themselves.
Here is how franchised quantum money might be useful: consider a group of large corporations, mutually distrustful, that nevertheless want to make transactions with each other. Further, a trusted third party, the mint, will administer the money system. While the mint cannot make verification public-key, it can franchise the ability to verify banknotes to the group of untrusted corporations. The mint gives each corporation a unique secret verification key that allows them to verify banknotes from another corporation.
Now what if one corporation decides to start using its key to copy money? Since each corporation gets a different key, any banknotes that the corporation produces will fail to verify when a different key is used. Therefore the dishonest corporation will not be able to fool anyone but themselves.
Public key quantum money has eluded sophisticated attempts to construct it directly, so franchised quantum money is useful as a stepping stone. Although franchised quantum money is not public-key, it still enables verification without the mint involved, which is the main feature of interest for public key quantum money. Further, we give a construction of franchised quantum money with a proof of security based on widely-held assumptions about the SIS problem. Franchised quantum money offers greater security than existing constructions of quantum money, and brings us closer to public-key verification.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster116Roberts.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Bhaskar Roberts</div></div></li><li value=121><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Communicating using non-maximally entangled states</div><div class=paper-authors>Sujan Vijayaraj (Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India);

The scheme is unusual, so it is difficult to analyze whether the scheme is secure and difficult to base the scheme’s security on any widespread computational assumptions. Instead, Zhandry proposed a new hardness assumption that, if true, could be used to prove security. While the new hardness assumption is plausible, it has not been rigorously analyzed.
In this work, we analyze the hardness assumption to determine how, if at all, it can be justified. We show that Zhandry’s hardness assumption is in fact false, so the proof of security for Zhandry’s scheme does not hold. While the scheme itself has not been proven insecure, our analysis suggests an approach to developing attacks that might prove the scheme insecure.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster122Roberts.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Bhaskar Roberts</div></div></li><li value=123><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between heralded pulsed photon sources with PPKTP</div><div class=paper-authors>Bo Li (University of Science and Technology of China)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a onclick="$('#abstract-123').toggle(200);return false">[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-123 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> Heralded single photons with a wavelength of 780 nm were generated from 30-mm long PPKTP crystals.

An experimental demonstration of device-independent quantum key distribution is however challenging. A central obstacle in photonic implementations is that the global detection efficiency, i.e., the probability that the signals sent over the quantum channel are successfully received, must be above a certain threshold. We here propose a method to significantly relax this threshold, while maintaining provable device-independent security. This is achieved with a protocol that adds artificial noise, which cannot be known or controlled by an adversary, to the initial measurement data (the raw key). Focusing on a realistic photonic setup using a source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion, we give explicit bounds on the minimal required global detection efficiency.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13015 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2005.13015]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster125Bancal.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Jean-Daniel Bancal</div></div></li><li value=128><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Dissipative dynamics of quantum states in the fiber channel</div><div class=paper-authors>Andrei Gaidash (ITMO University);

In order to obtain the appropriate evolution models for states in the channel we use the SU(1,1) algebra formalism in the Liouville representation. Developed model is applied in cases of two different initial states as an example. The first is single- and multi-frequency-mode (e.g. wavelength-division-multiplexed) weak coherent states in quantum notation as rather simple but useful example. This particular example is of interest since weak coherent states are commonly used tool in various fields of optics, e.g. optical communication, quantum key distribution, etc. Results for coherent states are well agreed with classical theories however in order to highlight quantum features of developed theory we also consider the case of non-classical light, in particular Fock states. Considered implementation of model takes into account dichroism, retardance, thermalization, dispersion, decoherence in polarization domain. We derive expressions of evolved states, mean photon number and estimate the Stokes parameters as well as degree of polarization.

Main difference to a prior studies in the field is that we do not use hyperentanglement or representation of the Bell states as concatenated Greenber–Horne–Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state to provide the discrimination. We demonstrate two different approaches for complete Bell state measurement based on different types of filtration. In entangled non-demolition measurement we allocate two pairs of the states from each other as the filtration process. The approach can be based on the utilization of cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity and auxiliary mode. In semi-demolition measurement two states are unambiguously discriminated and hence destroyed; however two other states passes the filter without modification. The measurement destroys the single photon subspace in every mode and preserves the superposition of zero and two photons. It can be realized with discrete photodetection based on microresonator with atoms. Such filtration can be considered as quadratic nonlinearity just as any measurement. The most significant about this approach is that we do not transform the initial states using any type of filtration based on different nonlinearities.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster129Kozubov.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=130><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Twin-field quantum key distribution with discrete phase randomization</div><div class=paper-authors>Guillermo Curras Lorenzo (University of Leeds);

Accompanying the QKD post-processing is the Quantum Point-to-Point Protocol (Q3P) node which enforces information-theoretically secure network peer-to-peer communication for classical applications. We already reported on the support for different DV and CV-QKD protocols, and high-performance error correction using GPUs for terrestrial QKD.
Here we will discuss the following new capabilities of the software
* a low dependency footprint for future use on satellites,
* hibernation of QKD post-processing pipelines and switching between them for key establishment with different ground terminals and satellites,
* CoAP interfaces to cover demands of the control and management plane in today’s network environment, and
* the port to ARM/FPGA SoC boards.
The CoAP interfaces allow rapid scripting of QKD modules or AIT QKD based applications with Python or even Bash. Utilities and tools, as well as a boilerplate setup for QKD module coding projects, also support the creation of new QKD post-processing modules or QKD based user applications. The AIT QKD software is bundled with management tools, partly GUI oriented.

We present a step in this direction by realizing a QRNG in the polymer-based photonic integration platform PolyBoard.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster134Achleitner.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Martin Achleitner</div></div></li><li value=136><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Parallelizing Single-Photon Detection for Ultra-Fast Quantum Key Distribution</div><div class=paper-authors>Matthias Häußler (Institute of Physics, University of Münster, Heisenbergstraße 11, 48149 Münster, Germany);

In the framework of integrated photonics, these needs can be fulfilled by patterning highly stable photonic devices on monolithic silicon chips in CMOS compatible processes. In this work we show how advanced single-photon detection capabilities are achieved on a silicon chip, realizing a 4x4 array of waveguide-integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs).
Our detectors are fabricated from highly uniform superconducting NbTiN thin films in a U-shape geometry atop of silicon nitride strip waveguides [1]. The nanophotonic circuitry is interfaced with scalable 3D polymeric out-of-plane fiber-to-chip couplers [2] featuring high broadband transmission in the telecom regime. In order to address each detector individually via a separate fiber-optic channel, we precisely align a 16-channel 2D fiber array to the 4x4 coupler matrix. We evaluate the performance of our waveguide-integrated SNSPD array in a cost-efficient closed-cycle cryostat at 3.5 K. We find dark count rates below 10 Hz combined with a superior system detection efficiency of up to 50 % at 30 MHz count rate for telecom-wavelength photons. In addition, we achieve 120 ps timing jitter with a simple two-stage room-temperature amplification approach.
Our detector arrays pave the way for parallelized multi-channel single-photon detection and will therewith enable ultra-fast quantum key distribution. Furthermore, our approach allows for integrating sophisticated nanophotonic devices with waveguide-coupled single-photon detectors providing additional variability and functionality.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster136Haeussler.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Matthias Häußler</div></div></li><li value=137><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>The QKD Testbed project OPENQKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Hannes Hübel (AIT Austian Institute of Technology)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a onclick="$('#abstract-137').toggle(200);return false">[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-137 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> The OPENQKD project is currently the largest QKD-focused initiative in Europe comprising of 38 partners.

Typically, the signal transmission rate is limited by the bandwidth of the detection. One of the drawbacks of
CV-QKD systems is low secure key generation rate at longer transmission distances. High bandwidth detectors—which allow higher signal transmission rates—cannot improve the key generation rate as these increase the electronic noise variance. Electronic noise variance in CV-QKD systems is considered as a trusted noise source and so theoretically, it does not have a great impact on the final key rate. However, from the practical point of view, there is impact on the performance of error correction codes—such as low density parity codes (LDPC). Increased electronic noise decreases the signalto-noise ratio (SNR). Constructing LDPC at lower SNR is a bottleneck for achieving long distance CV-QKD. Multi-mode signals can improve the SNR of CV-QKD system to a significant extent. In this work, we consider a multi-mode signal based CV-QKD system where signal modes are jointly measured in order to reduce the impact of electronic noise on the SNR.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="../posters/QCrypt2020Poster145Kumar.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Rupesh Kumar</div></div></li><li value=147><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Influence of birefringent fiber joints on the visibility drift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer</div><div class=paper-authors>G M Krylov (QRate, Moscow, Russia);
