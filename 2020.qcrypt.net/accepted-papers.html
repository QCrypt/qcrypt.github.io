  A Quantum Money Solution to the Blockchain Scalability Problem Andrea Coladangelo (Caltech); Or Sattath (Ben-Gurion University)  [abstract] Abstract: We put forward the idea that classical blockchains and smart contracts are potentially useful primitives not only for classical cryptography, but for quantum cryptography as well. Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool to enforce monetary incentives."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/accepted-papers/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://competent-nightingale-85ae87.netlify.com/images/social-share.jpg"><meta property="og:site_name" content="QCrypt 2020"><meta itemprop=name content="Accepted Papers"><meta itemprop=description content="List of Accepted Contributed Talks (in order of submission)

Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool to enforce monetary incentives.
In this work, we give the first example of the use of smart contracts in a quantum setting. We describe a simple hybrid classical-quantum payment system whose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful smart contracts, and quantum lightning, a strengthening of public-key quantum money introduced by Zhandry (Eurocrypt'19). Our hybrid payment system employs quantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and to keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties: it is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as quick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a quantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost value.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11998 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.11998]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/P5fpNHi9wLc target=_blank>[YouTube,

The client's goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi\cite{UBQC}, has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that were later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Previous works on this problem mainly focused on either information-theoretically (IT) secure protocols or techniques based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions).\par
In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, BFK\cite{UBQC}), our protocol has an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the online phase the client is entirely classical --- it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol's offline phase is \emph{succinct}, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Its complexity is only $poly(\kappa)$ where $poly$ is a fixed polynomial, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to $subexp(\kappa)$. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit \cite{UBQC}, or require trapdoor assumptions \cite{Mahadev2017}.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12621 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2006.12621]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/xqyOrRyXGPk target=_blank>[YouTube,

It is suitable for building a star-type quantum access network, where the complicated and expensive measurement devices are placed in the central untrusted relay and each user requires only a low-cost transmitter, such as an integrated photonic chip. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 1.25 GHz silicon photonic chip-based MDI-QKD system using polarization encoding. The photonic chip transmitters integrate the necessary encoding components for a standard QKD source. We implement random modulations of polarization states and decoy intensities, and demonstrate a finite-key secret rate of 31 bps over 36 dB channel loss (or 180 km standard fiber). This key rate is higher than state-of-the-art MDI-QKD experiments. The results show that silicon photonic chip-based MDI-QKD, benefiting from miniaturization, low-cost manufacture and compatibility with CMOS microelectronics, is a promising solution for future quantum secure networks.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00690 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1911.00690]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/vfe_zD4FWk0 target=_blank>[YouTube,

In this letter, we investigate uncharacterized MDI-QKD by utilizing a three-state method, greatly reducing the finite-size effect. The only requirement for state preparation is that the state are prepared in a bidimensional Hilbert space. Furthermore, a proof-of-principle demonstration over a 170 km transmission distance is achieved, representing the longest transmission distance under the same security level on record.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04944 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.04944]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/Gif4eh5lenA target=_blank>[YouTube,

In this work, we investigate its adaptation in the quantum world, when an adversary can perform superposition queries. The security of quantum-secure classical encryption has first been studied by Boneh and Zhandry (CRYPTO'13), but they restricted the adversary to classical challenge queries, which makes the indistinguishability only hold for classical messages (IND-qCCA2).
In this work, we give the first security notions for fully quantum indistinguishability under quantum adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks, where the indistinguishability holds for superposition of plaintexts (qIND-qCCA2). This resolves an open problem asked by Gagliardoni et al. (CRYPTO'16).
The qCCA2 security is defined in Boneh-Zhandry's paper using string copying and comparison, which is inherent in the classical setting. Quantumly, it is unclear what it means for a ciphertext to be different from the challenge ciphertext, and how the challenger can check the equality. The classical approach would either violate the no-cloning theorem or lead to perturbing the adversary's state, which may be detectable. To remedy these problems, from the recent groundbreaking compressed oracle technique introduced by Zhandry (CRYPTO'19), we develop a generic framework that allows to record quantum queries for probabilistic functions. We then give definitions for fully quantum real-or-random indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (qIND-qCCA2).
In the symmetric setting, we show that various classical modes of encryption are trivially broken in our security notions. We then provide the first formal proof for quantum security of the Encrypt-then-MAC paradigm, which also answers an open problem posed by Boneh and Zhandry.
In the public-key setting, we show how to achieve these stronger security notions (qIND-qCCA2) from any encryption scheme secure in the sense of Boneh-Zhandry (IND-qCCA2). Along the way, we also give the first definitions of non-malleability for classical encryption in the quantum world and show that the picture of the relations between these notions is essentially the same as in the classical setting.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/SIUpnJgvciY target=_blank>[YouTube,

Even in the extreme case where a computation is performed be- tween k mutually distrustful players, and security is required even for the single honest player if all other players are colluding adversaries, secure protocols are known. For quantum com- putation, on the other hand, protocols allowing arbitrary dishonest majority have only been proven for k = 2. In this work, we generalize the approach taken by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail (CRYPTO 2012) in the two-party setting to devise a secure, efficient protocol for multi- party quantum computation for any number of players k, and prove security against up to k − 1 colluding adversaries. The quantum round complexity of the protocol for computing a quantum circuit of {CNOT, T} depth d is O(k · (d + log n)), where n is the security parameter. To achieve efficiency, we develop a novel public verification protocol for the Clifford authen- tication code, and a testing protocol for magic-state inputs, both using classical multi-party computation.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13770 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1909.13770]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/RM1_a3XllVs target=_blank>[YouTube,

The corresponding security proofs usually assume that all physical detectors have the same detection efficiency. However, the efficiencies of the detectors used in practice might show a mismatch depending on the manufacturing and setup of these detectors. A mismatch can also be induced as the different spatial-temporal modes of an incoming
signal might couple differently to a detector. Here we develop a method that allows to provide security proofs without the usual assumption. Our method can take the detection-efficiency mismatch into account without having to restrict the attack strategy of the adversary. Especially, we do not rely on any photon-number cut-off of incoming signals such that our security proof is complete. Though we consider polarization encoding in the demonstration of our method, the method applies to a variety of coding mechanisms, including time-bin encoding, and also allows for general manipulations of the spatial-temporal modes by the adversary. We thus can close the long-standing question how to provide a valid, complete security proof of a QKD setup with characterized efficiency mismatch. Our method also shows that in the absence of efficiency mismatch, the key rate increases if the loss due to detection inefficiency is assumed to be outside of the adversary's control, as compared to the view where for a security proof
this loss is attributed to the action of the adversary.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04383 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2004.04383]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/NyAaJfdKgBc target=_blank>[YouTube,

it has become possible to implement a new class of device-independent
random number generators whose output can be certified to be uniformly
random without requiring a detailed model of the quantum devices used.
However, all previous experiments require many input bits in order to
certify a small number of output bits, and it is an outstanding challenge
to develop a system that generates more randomness than is used.
Here, we devise a device-independent spot-checking protocol which uses only
uniform bits as input. Implemented with a photonic loophole-free Bell test,
we can produce 24% more certified output bits (1,181,264,237 bits) than
consumed input bits (953,301,640 bits), which is 5 orders of magnitude
more efficient than our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 010505 (2020)].
The experiment ran for 91.0 hours, creating randomness at an average rate
of 3,606 bits/second with a soundness error bounded by 5.7e-7 in the
presence of classical side information. Our system will allow for greater
trust in public sources of randomness, such as randomness beacons, and
the protocol may one day enable high-quality sources of private randomness

Two natural questions that arise in this context are: (1) whether the results extend to the Fiat-Shamir transformation of *multi-round* interactive proofs, and (2) whether Don et al.'s O(q^2) loss in security is optimal.
Firstly, we answer question (1) in the affirmative. As a byproduct of solving a technical difficulty in proving this result, we slightly improve the result of Don et al., equipping it with a cleaner bound and an even simpler proof. We apply our result to digital signature schemes showing that it can be used to prove strong security for schemes like MQDSS in the QROM. As another application we prove QROM-security of a non-interactive OR proof by Liu, Wei and Wong.
As for question (2), we show via a Grover-search based attack that Don et al.'s quadratic security loss for the Fiat-Shamir transformation of sigma-protocols is optimal up to a small constant factor. This extends to our new multi-round result, proving it tight up to a factor that depends on the number of rounds only, i.e. is constant for any constant-round interactive proof.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05207 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2003.05207]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/eNWTjJi8yzE target=_blank>[YouTube,

A WCF protocol is said to have bias ε if neither party can force their preferred outcome with probability greater than 1/2+ε. Classical WCF protocols are shown to have bias 1/2, i.e., a cheating party can always force their preferred outcome. A lower bias can only be achieved by employing extra assumptions, such as computational hardness. On the other hand, there exist quantum WCF protocols with arbitrarily small bias, as Mochon showed in his seminal work in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114]. In particular, he proved the existence of a family of WCF protocols approaching bias ε(k) = 1/(4k + 2) for arbitrarily large k and proposed a protocol with bias 1/6. Last year, Arora, Roland and Weis presented a protocol with bias 1/10 and to go below this bias, they designed an algorithm that numerically constructs unitary matrices corresponding to WCF protocols with arbitrarily small bias [STOC’19, p.205-216]. In this work, we present new techniques which yield a fully analytical construction of WCF protocols with bias arbitrarily close to zero, thus achieving a solution that has been missing for more than a decade. Furthermore, our new techniques lead to a simplified proof of existence of WCF protocols by circumventing the non-constructive part of Mochon’s proof. The construction of an explicit WCF protocol approaching bias 1/14 is illustrated as an example.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/SNyY2nl68y0 target=_blank>[YouTube,

We distribute these states over up to 50km of optical fibre and implement custom multiparty error correction and privacy amplification on the resulting raw keys. From a finite-key analysis, we establish an information-theoretic secure key of up to 1.15 × 10^6 bits, which is used to encrypt and securely share an image between the four users. Surpassing the previous maximum distance for GHZ state transmission by more than an order of magnitude, these results demonstrate the viability of network protocols relying on multi-partite-entanglement.

In this work, we show that this same task can in fact be performed non-interactively and in zero-knowledge.
Our protocols result from a sequence of significant improvements to the original four-message protocol of Mahadev. We begin by making the first message instance-independent and moving it to an offline setup phase. We then establish a parallel repetition theorem for the resulting three-message protocol, with an asymptotically optimal rate. This, in turn, enables an application of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, eliminating the second message and giving a non-interactive protocol. Finally, we employ classical non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments and classical fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to give a zero-knowledge variant of this construction. This yields the first purely classical NIZK argument system for QMA, a quantum analogue of NP.
We establish the security of our protocols under standard assumptions in quantum-secure cryptography. Specifically, our protocols are secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model, under the assumption that Learning with Errors is quantumly hard. The NIZK construction also requires circuit-private FHE.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08101 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1911.08101]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/zfC1lZA8Q3Y target=_blank>[YouTube,

Good random numbers should be independent and uniformly distributed. Moreover, for cryptographic applications, they should also be unpredictable. A fundamental feature of quantum theory is that certain measurement outcomes are intrinsically random and unpredictable. These can be harnessed to provide unconditionally secure random numbers. We demonstrate a real-time self-testing source-independent quantum random-number generator (SI QRNG) that uses squeezed light as a source. We generate secure random numbers by measuring the quadratures of the electromagnetic field without making any assumptions about the source other than an energy bound; only the detection device is trusted. We use homodyne detection to measure alternately the Q and P conjugate quadratures of our source. P measurements allow us to estimate a bound on any classical or quantum side information that a malicious eavesdropper may obtain. This bound gives the minimum number of secure bits we can extract from the Q measurement. We discuss the performance of different estimators for this bound. We operate this QRNG with a squeezed-state source and compare its performance with a thermal-state source. This is a demonstration of a QRNG using a squeezed state, as well as an implementation of real-time quadrature switching for a SI QRNG.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01071 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1903.01071]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/o_h5LhBp8tc target=_blank>[YouTube,

Though quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are based on the intrinsic indeterministic nature of quantum properties, the presence of classical noise in the measurement process compromises the integrity of a QRNG. In this paper, we develop a predictive machine learning (ML) analysis to investigate the impact of deterministic classical noise in different stages of an optical continuous variable QRNG. Our ML model successfully detects inherent correlations when the deterministic noise sources are prominent. After appropriate filtering and randomness extraction processes are introduced, our QRNG system, in turn, demonstrates its robustness against ML. We further demonstrate the robustness of our ML approach by applying it to uniformly distributed random numbers from the QRNG and a congruential RNG. Hence, our result shows that ML has potentials in benchmarking the quality of RNG devices.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02342 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1905.02342]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/P7rOPYKGfu0 target=_blank>[YouTube,

In the case of simulating random states, the ideal object is an inputless oracle which outputs the same Haar-random n-qubit state whenever it is invoked. In the case of simulating random unitaries, the ideal object is an oracle which applies to its input the same Haar-random n-qubit unitary operator whenever it is invoked.
This problem has only been previously considered for restricted adversaries. Against adversaries with an a priori bound on the number of queries, it is well-known that t-designs suffice. Against polynomial-time adversaries, one can use pseudorandom states (PRS) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRU), as defined in a recent work of Ji, Liu, and Song; unfortunately, no provably secure construction is known for PRUs.
In our setting, we are concerned with unbounded adversaries. Nonetheless, we are able to give stateful quantum algorithms which simulate the ideal object in both settings of interest. In the case of Haar-random states, our simulator is polynomial-time, has negligible error, and can also simulate verification and reflection through the simulated state. This yields an immediate application to quantum money: a money scheme which is information-theoretically unforgeable and untraceable. In the case of Haar-random unitaries, our simulator takes polynomial space, but simulates both forward and inverse access with zero error.
These results can be seen as the first significant steps in developing a theory of lazy sampling for random quantum objects.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05729 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1910.05729]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/hUbfT4vQcIg target=_blank>[YouTube,

A key issue typical to all modern CV-QKD systems implemented with a reference or pilot signal and an independent local oscillator is controlling the excess noise generated from the frequency and phase noise accrued by the transmitter and receiver. Therefore accurate phase estimation and compensation, so-called carrier recovery, is a critical subsystem of CV-QKD. Here, we present the implementation of a machine learning framework based on Bayesian inference, namely an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), for estimation of phase noise and compare it to a standard reference method. Experimental results obtained over a 20 km fibre-optic link indicate that the UKF can ensure very low excess noise even at low pilot powers. The measurements exhibited low variance and high stability in excess noise over a wide range of pilot signal to noise ratios. This may enable CV-QKD systems with low implementation complexity which can seamlessly work on diverse transmission lines.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09321 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.09321]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/IzTgl1cuFHE target=_blank>[YouTube,

A promising direction that circumvents this impossibility result is to obfuscate classical circuits into quantum states, which would potentially be better capable of hiding information about the obfuscated circuit.

It thus represents the ultimate form of cryptography, offering not only information-theoretic security against channel attacks, but also against attacks exploiting implementation loopholes~\cite{lydersen2010hacking}. At its heart, DIQKD utilises nonlocal correlations---detected and certified by a Bell inequality---to establish secret correlations between the users. In recent years, much progress has been made towards realising the first DIQKD experiments, but current proposals are just out of reach of today’s loophole-free Bell experiments. Here, in this work, we close the gap between the theory and practice of DIQKD with a simple variant of the original protocol based on the celebrated Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality. In using two randomly chosen key generating bases instead of one, we show that the noise tolerance of DIQKD can be significantly improved. In particular, the extended feasibility region now covers some of the most recent loophole-free CHSH experiments, hence indicating that the first realisation of DIQKD already lies within the range of these experiments.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02691 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2005.02691]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/pWPILGPiz40 target=_blank>[YouTube,

This is often referred to as pseudorandom (quantum) state generator, or PRS generator for short.
In existing constructions of PRS generators, security scales with the number of qubits in the states, i.e. the (statistical) security parameter for an n-qubit PRS is roughly n.
Perhaps counter-intuitively, n-qubit PRS are not known to imply k-qubit PRS even for k&lt;n. Therefore the question of \emph{scalability} for PRS was thus far open: is it possible to construct n-qubit PRS generators with security parameter m for all n, m. Indeed, we believe that PRS with tiny (even constant) n and large m can be quite useful.
We resolve the problem in this work, showing that any quantum-secure one-way function implies scalable PRS. We follow the paradigm of first showing a \emph{statistically} secure construction when given oracle access to a random function, and then replacing the random function with a quantum-secure (classical) pseudorandom function to achieve computational security. However, our methods deviate significantly from prior works since scalable pseudorandom states require randomizing the amplitudes of the quantum state, and not just the phase as in all prior works. We show how to achieve this using Gaussian sampling.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01976 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2004.01976]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/Adgip7lGPuQ target=_blank>[YouTube,

Device-independent randomness generation (DIRNG) allows new randomness to be provably generated, without needing to trust the devices used for the protocol. This provides strong guarantees about the security of the output, but comes at the price of requiring the violation of a Bell inequality to implement. A further challenge is to make the bounds in the security proofs tight enough to allow expansion with contemporary technology. Thus, while randomness has been generated in recent experiments, the amount of randomness consumed in doing so has been too high to certify expansion based on existing theory. Here we present an experiment that demonstrates device-independent randomness expansion (DIRNE), i.e., where the generated randomness surpasses that consumed. By developing a loophole-free Bell test setup with a single photon detection efficiency of around 81% and exploiting a spot-checking protocol, we achieve a net gain of 2.63 × 10^8 certified bits with soundness error 5.74×10^{−8}. The experiment ran for 220 hours corresponding to an average rate of randomness generation of 8202 bits/s. By developing the Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT), we established security against quantum adversaries. We anticipate that this work will lead to further improvements that push device-independence towards commercial viability.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11159 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1912.11159]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid><a href=https://youtu.be/wpifGn_wS74 target=_blank>[YouTube,

In this paper, we show that multipartite private states from which secret keys are directly accessible to trusted partners are genuinely multipartite entangled states. With application to secure Quantum Internet, we consider the most general setup of multipartite quantum process (channel) in a network setting: multiplex quantum channel with involved parties having one of the three possible roles-- that of only sender or receiver, or both sender and receiver. We derive divergence-based measures for entangling abilities of multipartite quantum channels. We describe an LOCC-assisted secret key agreement (SKA) protocol for generation or distillation of key (private random bits) among multiple trusted allies connected through a quantum multiplex channel secure against a quantum eavesdropper, of which measurement-device-independent QKD and SKA protocols over quantum network laced with key repeaters are particular instances. We are able to provide upper bounds on the non-asymptotic private capacities, maximum rate at which secret key can be distilled via finite uses of channels, and lower bounds on asymptotic capacities. These bounds are expressed in terms of the divergence-based entanglement measures of the channels. Some of these measures lead to strong converse bounds on the private capacities. Our upper bounds on the private capacities also are upper bound on the multipartite quantum capacities where goal is to distill Greenberger{Horne{Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Also, we are able to derive upper bound on the secret key bits that can be distilled via LOCC among trusted allies sharing finite copies of multipartite quantum states.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03646 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1912.03646]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster004Das.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=8><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Security of QKD with weak basis-choice flaw</div><div class=paper-authors>Shihai Sun (School of Physics and Astronomy, Sun Yat-Sen University);

It is well-known that Simon's algorithm finds $\vec s$ in time polynomial in $n$ on quantum devices that are capable of performing error-correction. However, today's quantum devices are inherently noisy, too limited for error correction, and Simon's algorithm is not error-tolerant.
We show that even noisy quantum period finding computations lead to speedups in comparison to purely classical computations. More precisely, we implemented Simon's quantum period finding circuit on the $15$-qubit quantum device IBM Q 16 Melbourne. Our experiments show that with a certain probability $\tau(n)$ we measure erroneous vectors that are not orthogonal to $\vec s$. We propose new, simple, but very effective smoothing techniques to classically mitigate physical noise effects such as e.g. IBM Q's bias towards the $0$-qubit.
After smoothing, our noisy quantum device provides us a statistical distribution that we can easily transform into an LPN instance with parameters $n$ and $\tau(n)$. Hence, in the noisy case we may not hope to find periods in time polynomial in $n$. However, we still obtain quantum advantage even for large errors $\tau(n)$ close to $\frac 1 2$. Thus, period finding does not necessarily require full quantum error correction capability.

In this work, we present a robust implementation of a Semi-Device-Independent QRNG that guarantees both security and fast generation rates.
The system works in a prepare and measure scenario where measurement and source are untrusted, but a bound on the energy of the prepared states is assumed. Our implementation exploits heterodyne detection, which offers increased generation rate and improved long-term stability compared to alternative measurement strategies. In particular, due to the tomographic properties of heterodyne measurement, we can compensate for fast phase fluctuations via post-processing, avoiding complex active phase stabilization systems. As a result, our scheme combines high security and speed with a simple setup featuring only commercial-off-the-shelf components, making it an attractive solution in many practical scenarios.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster045Tebyanian.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=48><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Security analysis of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution</div><div class=paper-authors>Jie Lin (Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo);

A vast number of applications critically rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers that are generated securely. In this work we introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework, named \emph{incoherent randomness extraction} (IRE), in the context of quantum coherence theory where free incoherent operations are employed. This cryptographic framework unveils a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence distillation (QCD) by an \emph{exact} one-shot connection, that is, the maximum number of secure random bits extractable from a single instance of \emph{unstructured} quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum number of coherent bits that can be distilled from the same state. This exact relation not only sharpens our understanding on the operational equivalence between randomness and coherence, but also enables us to derive tight second order expansions (estimation of the number of extractable random bits/distillable coherent bits to the order~$o(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of the prepared source states) of both tasks in the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states all lead to the same second order expansions, indicating their operational equivalence for QCD as well as IRE in both asymptotic and large block length regimes. As a by-product, we showcase a proof of the strong converse property for IRE from its second order expansion, excluding a possible tradeoff between the insecurity threshold and the rate of extractable randomness of a protocol. This also contributes to an alternative strong converse proof for QCD due to their exact one-shot correspondence.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12004 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.12004]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster051Fang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Kun Fang</div></div></li><li value=60><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Nonlocal games, synchronous correlations, and Bell inequalities</div><div class=paper-authors>Nishant Rodrigues (University of Maryland);

Here, we first provide an efficient algorithm for completely characterizing the behaviour of a large class of repeater chain protocols. The algorithm determines the fidelity and generation time (waiting time) of the first generated entangled pair between the end nodes of a quantum repeater chain. It has polynomial runtime in the size of the support of the waiting time probability distribution. This runtime improves upon the exponential runtime of existing algorithms and allows us to analyze repeater chains of thousands of segments for some parameter regimes. Second, we use the algorithm for optimizing the achievable secret key rate. For this, we consider a family of repeater schemes generalizing the BDCZ scheme. In particular, the schemes incorporate a cut-off condition that enables to mitigate the effects of decoherence. We find that the use of the optimal cut-off extends the parameter regime for which secret key can be generated and moreover significantly increases the secret-key rate for a large range of parameters.

We propose an explicit d-dimensional key distribution protocol, that we call MUB-Quantum Computational Timelock (MUB-QCT) where one bit is encoded on a qudit state chosen among d + 1 mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Short-term-secure encryption is used to share the basis information with legitimate users while keeping it unknown from Eve until after her quantum memory decoheres. This allows to reduce Eve’s optimal attack to an immediate measurement followed by post-measurement decoding.
We demonstrate that MUB-QCT enables everlasting secure key distribution with input states containing up to O(\sqrt{d})photons.

In our framework, $d$-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) where $d$ is not fixed {\it a priori},
and measurement operators possibly not compatible, are allowed. This loss of constraints yields a
higher value of $4$ for the maximum expectation of CHSH-3, attained for $d=3 $ and non-commutative measurements for one party. Based on such upper bound on the violation of free CHSH-3, which appear to be a non-algebraic bound, we
develop a random number generator with only one party.
Our protocol generates a maximal entropy and its security is based, through self testing arguments, on the attainability of the
maximal violation of the free CHSH-3 for quantum systems.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00124 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2003.00124]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster090ANOMAN.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Anoman Don Jean Baptiste</div></div></li><li value=94><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Is Classical Remote State Preparation Composable?</div><div class=paper-authors>Christian Badertscher (University of Edinburgh);

With this primitive quantum protocols (such as secure delegation of quantum computations) become accessible to classical clients, by removing the need for a quantum channel. Since this cryptographic primitive’s main role is to be a building block within larger protocols, it is of utmost importance to examine its security under composition. In this work we present three results related to the composability of RSPCC protocols:
1. As our first main result, we show that no classical remote state preparation protocol RSPCC can be composable in the Abstract Cryptography framework [MR11], even when the distinguisher is computationally bounded. In other words, remote state preparation cannot be constructed with only a classical channel.
2. We further show that any classical-client delegated quantum computing protocol that uses the universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol [BFK09] and a RSPCC protocol as a subroutine cannot be composable.
3. Upon relaxing the security requirement, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the UBQC protocol by the particular RSPCC protocol of [CCKW19] is secure in the game-based security framework.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01668 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2007.01668]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster094Colisson.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Léo Colisson</div></div></li><li value=95><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Security for Quantum Networks</div><div class=paper-authors>Salini Karuvade (University of Calgary);

Specifically, we propose to encode the transmitted qubits in a concatenated code consisting of two levels. On the first level we use a continuous variable GKP code which encodes the qubit in a single bosonic mode. On the second level we use a small discrete variable code, encoding a logical qubit in as few as seven physical qubits. Such an architecture introduces two major novelties which allow us to make efficient use of resources. Firstly, our architecture makes use of two types of quantum repeaters: the simpler GKP repeaters that need to only be able to store and correct errors on a single GKP qubit and more powerful but more costly multi-qubit repeaters that additionally can correct errors on the higher level. We find that the combination of using the two types of repeaters enables us to achieve performance needed in practical scenarios with a significantly reduced cost with respect to an architecture based solely on multiqubit repeaters. Secondly the use of continuous variable GKP code on the lower level has the advantage of providing us with the information about the success probability of the specific GKP correction round. This analog information, unique to bosonic codes, provides significant boost in performance when used to correct second level errors in the multi-qubit repeaters.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster096Rozpedek.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Filip Rozpedek</div></div></li><li value=101><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Entanglement generation in a quantum network at distance-independent rates</div><div class=paper-authors>Ashlesha Patil (College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA);

If we allow even 3-fusions at the nodes, we find by developing a connection to a modified version of the site-bond percolation problem that despite lossy (hence probabilistic) link-level entanglement generation, and probabilistic success of the fusion measurements at nodes, one can generate entanglement between end two parties at a rate that stays constant as the distance between them increases.

However, achieving this task over global distances (thousands of km) is very daunting, due to the exponential losses of light in optical fibres.
The concept of a quantum repeater has been introduced to counter this problem. Such a device allows, using quantum memories and protocols based on entanglement swapping or quantum error correction, to connect several elementary links and enlarge the achievable distance.
An alternative solution is represented by satellite-relayed free-space channels, that have already been proven to be feasible with current technology. Using a double downlink from a single satellite, however, the maximum distance between the ground stations is limited to {1500-2000} km, due to the additional losses encountered at low elevation angles. Through quantum repeaters, few of these satellite links can be chained together to reach global distances. In this work we propose and study a scheme in which entanglement sources and quantum repeaters are placed on board of satellites, orbiting around the Earth in the string of pearls configuration. This allows to connect two users on the ground via free-space optical links outside the atmosphere, achieving far superior distance-to-loss ratio with respect to the standard fibre-based implementation. In this way, a small number of intermediate nodes is enough to achieve entanglement distribution over global distances at a reasonable rate.
The performance of this repeater chain is assessed in terms of the secret key rate achievable by the BB-84 cryptographic protocol, taking into account the most important sources of noise. We perform a comparison with other repeater chain architectures and show that our scheme is superior in almost every situation, achieving higher key rates, reliability and flexibility. These results have been obtained assuming reasonably conservative values of the parameters of the setup, such as the size of the optical elements and the efficiency of the quantum memories.
The feasibility of the implementation in the mid-term future is analysed, based on recent developments in space-borne technology. We finally discuss some exemplary orbital configurations to connect several pairs of cities around the world with very small satellite constellations and estimate the cost of such an infrastructure.
The integration of satellite-based links with ground repeater networks can be envisaged to represent the backbone of the future Quantum Internet.

As a result, there is interest in creating uncounterfeitable quantum money, in which a set of qubits can be spent as money but cannot be duplicated. To function as money, there must be a way to verify that a given state is a valid banknote and not a counterfeit. Many recent efforts have tried to allow public key verification, where any untrusted user, even a would-be counterfeiter, can verify the banknotes. However, despite many attempts, a secure construction of public-key quantum money has remained elusive.
Here we introduce franchised quantum money, a new notion that is weaker than public key quantum money but brings us closer to realizing it. Franchised quantum money allows any untrusted user to verify banknotes using a unique secret key. Furthermore, we give a construction of franchised quantum money and prove security assuming the quantum hardness of the short-integer solution problem (SIS). This is the first construction of quantum money that allows an untrusted user to verify the banknotes, and which has a proof of security based on widespread assumptions. It is therefore an important step toward public key quantum money.
Under franchised quantum money, untrusted users receive unique secret verification keys. With their key, a user can verify banknotes without the mint involved, but they cannot create counterfeit money that would fool another user. This is different from public key quantum money because the verification key may actually enable counterfeiting, but the only person that the counterfeiter can fool is themselves.
Here is how franchised quantum money might be useful: consider a group of large corporations, mutually distrustful, that nevertheless want to make transactions with each other. Further, a trusted third party, the mint, will administer the money system. While the mint cannot make verification public-key, it can franchise the ability to verify banknotes to the group of untrusted corporations. The mint gives each corporation a unique secret verification key that allows them to verify banknotes from another corporation.
Now what if one corporation decides to start using its key to copy money? Since each corporation gets a different key, any banknotes that the corporation produces will fail to verify when a different key is used. Therefore the dishonest corporation will not be able to fool anyone but themselves.
Public key quantum money has eluded sophisticated attempts to construct it directly, so franchised quantum money is useful as a stepping stone. Although franchised quantum money is not public-key, it still enables verification without the mint involved, which is the main feature of interest for public key quantum money. Further, we give a construction of franchised quantum money with a proof of security based on widely-held assumptions about the SIS problem. Franchised quantum money offers greater security than existing constructions of quantum money, and brings us closer to public-key verification.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster116Roberts.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Bhaskar Roberts</div></div></li><li value=121><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Communicating using non-maximally entangled states</div><div class=paper-authors>Sujan Vijayaraj (Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India);

We here propose a method to significantly relax this threshold, while maintaining provable device-independent security. This is achieved with a protocol that adds artificial noise, which cannot be known or controlled by an adversary, to the initial measurement data (the raw key). Focusing on a realistic photonic setup using a source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion, we give explicit bounds on the minimal required global detection efficiency.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13015 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2005.13015]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster125Bancal.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Jean-Daniel Bancal</div></div></li><li value=128><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Dissipative dynamics of quantum states in the fiber channel</div><div class=paper-authors>Andrei Gaidash (ITMO University);

In order to obtain the appropriate evolution models for states in the channel we use the SU(1,1) algebra formalism in the Liouville representation. Developed model is applied in cases of two different initial states as an example. The first is single- and multi-frequency-mode (e.g. wavelength-division-multiplexed) weak coherent states in quantum notation as rather simple but useful example. This particular example is of interest since weak coherent states are commonly used tool in various fields of optics, e.g. optical communication, quantum key distribution, etc. Results for coherent states are well agreed with classical theories however in order to highlight quantum features of developed theory we also consider the case of non-classical light, in particular Fock states. Considered implementation of model takes into account dichroism, retardance, thermalization, dispersion, decoherence in polarization domain. We derive expressions of evolved states, mean photon number and estimate the Stokes parameters as well as degree of polarization. Considered examples explicitly demonstrates all the features and effects of developed approach. Described approach allows to connect the information properties of quantum channels with its physical ones. In order to illustrate this statement we consider BB84 quantum key distribution protocol and investigate behavior of quantum bit error rate affected by considered physical phenomena in optical fiber.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster128Gaidash.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Andrei Gaidash</div></div></li><li value=129><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Complete Bell state analyser for photonic qubits using semi-demolition or entangled non-demolition measurements</div><div class=paper-authors>Anton Kozubov (ITMO University);

Main difference to a prior studies in the field is that we do not use hyperentanglement or representation of the Bell states as concatenated Greenber–Horne–Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state to provide the discrimination. We demonstrate two different approaches for complete Bell state measurement based on different types of filtration. In entangled non-demolition measurement we allocate two pairs of the states from each other as the filtration process. The approach can be based on the utilization of cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity and auxiliary mode. In semi-demolition measurement two states are unambiguously discriminated and hence destroyed; however two other states passes the filter without modification. The measurement destroys the single photon subspace in every mode and preserves the superposition of zero and two photons. It can be realized with discrete photodetection based on microresonator with atoms. Such filtration can be considered as quadratic nonlinearity just as any measurement. The most significant about this approach is that we do not transform the initial states using any type of filtration based on different nonlinearities.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster129Kozubov.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div></div></li><li value=130><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Twin-field quantum key distribution with discrete phase randomization</div><div class=paper-authors>Guillermo Curras Lorenzo (University of Leeds);

This software provides a set of building blocks to integrate sifting, error estimation, error correction, confirmation, privacy amplification and information-theoretically secure message authentication. Accompanying the QKD post-processing is the Quantum Point-to-Point Protocol (Q3P) node which enforces information-theoretically secure network peer-to-peer communication for classical applications. We already reported on the support for different DV and CV-QKD protocols, and high-performance error correction using GPUs for terrestrial QKD.
Here we will discuss the following new capabilities of the software
* a low dependency footprint for future use on satellites,
* hibernation of QKD post-processing pipelines and switching between them for key establishment with different ground terminals and satellites,
* CoAP interfaces to cover demands of the control and management plane in today’s network environment, and
* the port to ARM/FPGA SoC boards.
The CoAP interfaces allow rapid scripting of QKD modules or AIT QKD based applications with Python or even Bash. Utilities and tools, as well as a boilerplate setup for QKD module coding projects, also support the creation of new QKD post-processing modules or QKD based user applications. The AIT QKD software is bundled with management tools, partly GUI oriented.
The software is available under different license options and AIT welcomes suggestions from academic groups or industry to co-operate.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster132Maurhart.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Oliver Maurhart</div></div></li><li value=134><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>A quantum random number generator based on a polymer photonic-integration platform</div><div class=paper-authors>Martin Achleitner (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology);

In the framework of integrated photonics, these needs can be fulfilled by patterning highly stable photonic devices on monolithic silicon chips in CMOS compatible processes. In this work we show how advanced single-photon detection capabilities are achieved on a silicon chip, realizing a 4x4 array of waveguide-integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs).
Our detectors are fabricated from highly uniform superconducting NbTiN thin films in a U-shape geometry atop of silicon nitride strip waveguides [1]. The nanophotonic circuitry is interfaced with scalable 3D polymeric out-of-plane fiber-to-chip couplers [2] featuring high broadband transmission in the telecom regime. In order to address each detector individually via a separate fiber-optic channel, we precisely align a 16-channel 2D fiber array to the 4x4 coupler matrix. We evaluate the performance of our waveguide-integrated SNSPD array in a cost-efficient closed-cycle cryostat at 3.5 K. We find dark count rates below 10 Hz combined with a superior system detection efficiency of up to 50 % at 30 MHz count rate for telecom-wavelength photons. In addition, we achieve 120 ps timing jitter with a simple two-stage room-temperature amplification approach.
Our detector arrays pave the way for parallelized multi-channel single-photon detection and will therewith enable ultra-fast quantum key distribution. Furthermore, our approach allows for integrating sophisticated nanophotonic devices with waveguide-coupled single-photon detectors providing additional variability and functionality.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster136Haeussler.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Matthias Häußler</div></div></li><li value=137><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>The QKD Testbed project OPENQKD</div><div class=paper-authors>Hannes Hübel (AIT Austian Institute of Technology)</div><div class=paper-abstract><a onclick="$('#abstract-137').toggle(200);return false">[abstract]</a><div class=paper-abstract-full id=abstract-137 style=display:none><b>Abstract:</b> The OPENQKD project is currently the largest QKD-focused initiative in Europe comprising of 38 partners.

Typically, the signal transmission rate is limited by the bandwidth of the detection. One of the drawbacks of
CV-QKD systems is low secure key generation rate at longer transmission distances. High bandwidth detectors—which allow higher signal transmission rates—cannot improve the key generation rate as these increase the electronic noise variance. Electronic noise variance in CV-QKD systems is considered as a trusted noise source and so theoretically, it does not have a great impact on the final key rate. However, from the practical point of view, there is impact on the performance of error correction codes—such as low density parity codes (LDPC). Increased electronic noise decreases the signalto-noise ratio (SNR). Constructing LDPC at lower SNR is a bottleneck for achieving long distance CV-QKD. Multi-mode signals can improve the SNR of CV-QKD system to a significant extent. In this work, we consider a multi-mode signal based CV-QKD system where signal modes are jointly measured in order to reduce the impact of electronic noise on the SNR.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster145Kumar.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Rupesh Kumar</div></div></li><li value=147><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Influence of birefringent fiber joints on the visibility drift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer</div><div class=paper-authors>G M Krylov (QRate, Moscow, Russia);

In terms of technique, our main contribution is a strong parallel repetition theorem for NTCF.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08889 target=_blank>[arXiv: 1908.08889]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster011Radian.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Roy Radian

For a periodic function $f$ these algorithms produce -- via some quantum embedding of $f$ -- a quantum superposition $\sum_x \ket{x}\ket{f(x)}$, which requires a certain amount of output qubits that represent $\ket{f(x)}$. We show that one can lower this amount to a single output qubit by hashing $f$ down to a single bit in an oracle setting.
Namely, we replace the embedding of $f$ in quantum period finding circuits by oracle access to several embeddings of hashed versions of $f$. We show that on expectation this modification only doubles the required amount of quantum measurements, while significantly reducing the total number of qubits. For example, for Simon's period finding algorithm in some $n$-bit function $f: \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^n$ our hashing technique reduces the required output qubits from $n$ down to $1$, and therefore the total amount of qubits from $2n$ to $n+1$. We also show that Simon's algorithm admits real world applications with only $n+1$ qubits by giving a concrete realization of a hashed version of the cryptographic Even-Mansour construction.
Our oracle-based hashed version of the Ekerå-Håstad algorithm for factoring $n$-bit RSA reduces the required qubits from $(\frac 3 2 + o(1))n$ down to $(\frac 1 2 + o(1))n$. In principle our hashing approach also works for the Mosca-Ekert algorithm, but requires strong properties of the hash function family. A hashed version of Mosca-Ekert with as few as $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits would imply classical polynomial time factoring.

However, there are still no intrinsic `quantum-to-quantum' quantum one-way functions. In this paper, we propose the full quantum one-way function to design full quantum cryptographic schemes. By concatenating the `quantum-classical' one-way function and the rotation operation of a single qubit, the full quantum one-way function has the input and output of quantum states. We prove its one-way property from `easy computation' and `computationally difficult to invert'. Then we apply the full quantum one-way function to quantum identity authentication.

In this paper, we investigate QKD (quantum key distribution) as an alternative source of trust for MACsec. QKD can be used as either a root key provider or a session key generator.

Similar to bills of paper money, most quantum money schemes assign a unique serial number to each money state, thus potentially compromising the privacy of the users of quantum money. However in a quantum coins scheme, just like the traditional currency coin scheme, all the money states are exact copies of each other, providing a better level of privacy for the users.
A quantum money scheme can be private, i.e., only the bank can verify the money states, or public, meaning anyone can verify. In this work, we propose a way to lift any private quantum coin scheme -- which is known to exist based on the existence of one-way functions, due to Ji, Liu, and Song (CRYPTO'18) -- to a scheme that closely resembles a public quantum coin scheme. Verification of a new coin is done by comparing it to the coins the user already possesses, by using a projector on to the symmetric subspace. No public coin scheme was known prior to this work. It is also the first construction that is very close to a public quantum money scheme and is provably secure based on standard assumptions. The lifting technique when instantiated with the private quantum coins scheme, due to Mosca and Stebila 2010, gives rise to the first construction that is very close to an inefficient unconditionally secure public quantum money scheme.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12438 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.12438]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster034Behera.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Amit Behera

Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) takes PIR further by additionally offering database privacy, where the user cannot learn any additional entries of the database. Unconditionally secure SPIR solutions with multiple databases are known classically, but are unrealistic because they require long shared secret keys between the parties for secure communication and shared randomness in the protocol. Here, we propose using quantum key distribution (QKD) instead for a practical implementation, which can realise both the secure communication and shared randomness requirements. We prove that QKD maintains the security of the SPIR protocol and that it is also secure against any external eavesdropper. We also show how such a classical-quantum system could be implemented practically, using the example of a two-database SPIR protocol with keys generated by measurement device-independent QKD.

For this purpose, we developed a basic QKD testbed comprising a triggered solid-state single-photon source and a receiver module designed for four-state polarization coding via the BB84 protocol. Exploiting temporal filtering of the signal acceptance time window in a two-dimensional parameter space we analyze the sifted key fraction and the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) expected in in full implementations of QKD.

Such an amount of power may modify the characteristics of components in a source. In this work, we study possible components to protect the source from the light-injected attacks, i.e., Trojan-horse attack, the laser-seeding attack, and the laser-damage attack. Experimental testing shows that fiber-optics isolators and circulators are good passive countermeasures because they sacrifice themselves' isolation under a high-power laser to protect other components behind them.

once a state is shared among them and provides composable security, namely it can be
used as a secure subroutine by n honest parties within larger communication protocols
to test if a source is sharing quantum states that are at least Ɛ-close to the GHZ state.
This claim comes on top of previous results on multipartite entanglement verification
where the security was studied in the usual game-based model. Here, we improve the
protocol to make it more suitable for practical use in a quantum network and we study
its security in the Abstract Cryptography framework to highlight composability issues
and avoid hidden assumptions. This framework is a top-to-bottom theory that makes
explicit any piece of information that each component (party or resource) gets at every
time-step of the protocol. Moreover any security proof, which amounts to showing
indistinguishability between an ideal resource having the desired security properties (up
to local simulation) and the concrete resource representing the protocol, is composable
for free in this setting. This allows us to readily compose our basic protocol in order to
create a composably secure multi-round protocol enabling honest parties to obtain a
state close to a GHZ state or an abort signal, even in the presence of a noisy or malicious

securely share a GHZ state among the network before performing a communication or

In this work, we propose an efficient technique called double-decoy method which can provide relevant partial information of the input-output photon-number distribution, including the fraction of events in which the unknown quantum channel accepts and outputs a single photon. These detections correspond to events in which the transmitted single photon survives a basis-independent filter just before the measurement. We apply the double-decoy method to quantum key distribution (QKD) and show that it can substantially reduce the background noise and systematic error at the privacy amplification level, thereby improving the current secret key rate and achievable distance for standard QKD protocols.

Almost all attacks have been demonstrated on devices based on fibre components. However, the first chip-scale QKD devices are being developed now, utilising the small size of integrated optics, the stability of the optical system and the ease at which it can be mass-produced, showing great commercial potential. Here we discuss a THA on chip-scale QKD. First, points of reflection in a QKD transmitter chip were found via a reflectometry. Based on this we give an experimental set-up to implement a THA which would give Eve access to 50% of the key.

Most of these applications such as delegated quantum computation require running a secure identification protocol between a low-resource and a high-resource party to provide secure communication. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been shown as resource-efficient hardware solutions for providing secure identification schemes in both classical and quantum settings. In this work, we propose two identification protocols based on quantum PUFs (qPUFs) as defined recently by Arapinis et al.
In the first protocol, the low-resource party wishes to prove its identity to the high-resource party and in the second protocol, it is vice versa. Unlike existing identification protocols based on Quantum Read-out of PUFs which rely on the security against a specific family of attacks, our protocols provide provable exponential security against any Quantum Polynomial-Time adversary with only polynomial resource parties. We provide a comprehensive comparison between the two proposed protocols in terms of resources such as quantum memory and computing ability required in both parties as well as the communication overhead between them. A stand-out feature of our second protocol is secure identification of a high-resource party by running a purely classical verification algorithm. This is achieved by delegating quantum operations to the high-resource party and utilising the resulting classical outcomes for identification.
An interesting application idea that emerges from our second protocol is certification or benchmarking of general quantum computation schemes based on purely running a classical test on the resulting measurement outcomes.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04522 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2006.04522]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster072Doosti-Delavar.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Mina Doosti, Mahshid Delavar, Niraj Kumar

Device-independent quantum random number generators (QRNGs) provide a means of completely trusted randomness, but are highly impractical due to their strict technological requirements, such as loophole-free quantum nonlocality.
By making fixed assumptions on specific parts of the device, semi-device-independent QRNGs lower these requirements drastically.
However, this {has usually been} done at the cost of limiting their flexibility and security to a specific physical implementation and level of trust.
Here we propose and experimentally test a new framework for semi-device-independent randomness certification that employs a flexible set of assumptions, allowing it to be applied in a range of physical scenarios involving both quantum and classical entropy sources.
At the heart of our method lies a source of trusted vacuum in the form of a signal shutter, which enables the honesty of partially trusted measurement devices to be tested and provides lower bounds on the guessing probability of their measurement outcomes.
We experimentally verify our protocol with a photonic setup and generate secure random bits under three different source assumptions with varying degrees of security and resulting data rates.
Our work demonstrates a simple and practical way for achieving semi-device-independent randomness generation with user-defined flexibility in terms of levels of trust and physical implementations.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12295 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2002.12295]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster075Pivoluska.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Matej Pivoluska

In some security demanding contexts, the perfect confidentiality that can be obtained with QKD combined with One-Time-Pad, may be insufficient. This will be in particular the case if the mere existence of communication can divulge crucial information. Performing QKD covertly solves this by insuring low probability of detection for the QKD signal states.
We study here for the first time Covert continuous variable (CV) QKD. We establish, in the general case of a thermal noise channel, that the covertness conditions impose drastic limits to the performance of such protocols. We then propose an original solution to overcome this limitation by performing a computationally-secure coherent block encoding, analogous to spread spectrum, to the signal pulses of a Gaussian modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol.
The resulting protocol provides covertness, under computational assumptions while preserving the information-theoretical security on the final QKD key. We show that our method enables QKD over realistic WDM environments such as a 30 km optical backbone populated by 25 standard channels.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster078Aymeric.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Raphaël AYMERIC

Another intuition is that enforcing measurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from these attacks.
However, the reality is much more complex. The security models dealing with superposition attacks only consider unconditional security. The first seminal papers date back to 1997 and prove the impossibility of unconditionally-secure bit-commitment schemes. Follow-up works heavily rely on this assumption of unconditional security to prove strong impossibility
results and their proof techniques cannot be applied to the computational setting. They essentially indicate that ideal primitives should in fact measure the input state. On the opposite, security models considering computational security assume that all supposedly classical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of superposition attacks.
To fill in the gap between those models, Boneh and Zhandry have started to study the quantum computational security for classical primitives in their seminal work at Crypto'13, but only in the single-party setting. To the best of our knowledge, an equivalent model in the multiparty setting is still missing.
In this work, we propose the first computational security model considering superposition attacks for multiparty protocols. We show that our new security model is satisfiable by proving the security of the well-known One-Time-Pad protocol and show an attack on a variant of the equally reputable Yao Protocol for Secure Two-Party Computations. The post-mortem of this attack reveals the precise points of failure, yielding highly counter-intuitive results: The attack vector consists of a (classically) seemingly inoffensive message and a measurement performed by the honest player. This example shows that adding extra classical communication, which is harmless for classical security, can make the protocol become subject to superposition attacks.
Our results show that intuitions can be misleading when reasoning about cryptographic protocols in a quantum world, and that there is no evident answer to provide for either the vulnerabilities of classical protocols to superposition attacks or the adapted countermeasures.</div></div><div class=paper-arxivid><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00677 target=_blank>[arXiv: 2007.00677]</a></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster084Music.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Luka Music

Motivated by this, in this work we revisit the formal security of the core of the Bitcoin protocol, called the Bitcoin backbone, in the presence of an adversary that has access to a scalable quantum computer. We prove that the protocol’s essential properties stand in the post-quantum setting assuming a general quantum adversary with suitably bounded number of queries in the Quantum Random Oracle (QRO) model. In order to achieve this, we investigate
and bound the quantum complexity of a Chain-of-Proofs-of-Work search problem which is at the core of the blockchain protocol. Our results imply that security can be shown by bounding the quantum queries so that each quantum query is worth O(p^{−1/2}) classical ones and that the

These operations consist of a direct measurements on the devices followed by Local Operations and Public Communication (MDLOPC). We formulate a security condition for the considered class of protocols, that is based on the newly introduced non-signaling norm. This norm takes supremum over certain operations, that can be used to discriminate devices. It is shown that the security condition based on this norm, is equivalent to two security conditions present in the literature. We employ the idea of ``squashing" on the secrecy monotones, which provide upper bounds on the key rate in secret key agreement (SKA) scenario, and show that squashed secrecy monotones are the upper bounds on NSDI key. As an important instance, an upper bound on NSDI key rate called ``squashed non-locality", has been constructed. It exhibits several important properties, including convexity, monotonicity, and additivity on tensor products. Using this bound, we identify numerically a domain of two binary inputs and two binary outputs non-local devices for which the squashed non-locality is zero. Therefore one can not distill key from them via MDLOPC operations. These are mixtures of Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) and anti-PR box with the weight of PR less than 80%. This example confirms the intuition that non-locality need not imply secrecy in the non-signaling scenario. The approach is general, describing how to construct other tighter yet possibly less computable upper bounds. Our technique for obtaining upper bounds is based on the non-signaling analog of quantum purification: the complete extension. This extension provides the ultimate eavesdropping power with the minimal consumption of eavesdropper's memory and, as we prove, yields equivalent security conditions as previously known in the literature.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf>[no PDF yet]</div></div></li><li value=102><div class=paper-single><div class=paper-title>Ultrafast and practical Bell-based quantum randomness generation with classical optical homodyne detection</div><div class=paper-authors>Chao Wang (Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore);

Due to the possibility of free space communication, in general, the application candidates of free space QKD are focused on secure communication between moving terminals. Such applications have characteristics such as moving position, outside operation, and limited internal space and power consumption. First, the moving position of a terminal needs active compensation of a shared reference between transmitter and receiver because general QKD protocols requires a shared reference frame, i.e., polarization reference in a QKD protocol using polarization encoding. This can be solved by using reference frame independent (RFI) QKD. Second, the outside operation brings intensive noise issue caused by the sun light which significantly degrades the performance of free-space QKD. The change of operating wavelength of QKD to 1550-nm and single mode fiber coupling can significantly alleviate the noise issue. Finally, the limitation of internal space requires to chip scale implementation. The use of 1550-nm wavelength provides comparability of integrated (silicon) photonic chips which is already studied in the fiber based QKD.
In this paper, we provide a 1550-nm free-space RFI QKD system which incorporates the aforementioned solutions while the previous free-space RFI QKD is realized with visible wavelength. We also shows that our system achieves about 0.8% quantum bit error rate (QBER) without additional blocking out external light to the receiver through single mode fiber coupling. This low QBER indicates the possibility of daylight free-space QKD.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster118Lim.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Kyongchun Lim

Most of the free-space QKD systems require integration of various signals such as quantum and beam tracking channels with different wavelengths into the same optical path for beam tracking. The beam tracking system, consisting of fast steering mirrors and position detectors, maintains optical beam path by adjusting the misalignments induced by moving terminals, vibrations and atmospheric turbulence in the free-space QKD system. Most QKD systems use dichroic mirrors for combining and separating quantum and beam tracking channels through free-space alignment. However, integration of such channels in free-space could require a large volume space, much alignment effort for mode overlap and can be easily affected by mechanical shock.
In this paper, we report the effect of using a fiber-based wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter for integrating the quantum and beam tracking channels in free-space QKD systems. A custom-made WDM filter was used in the transmitter part of the free-space BB84 QKD system, combining a 785 nm signal for quantum channel and a 1550 nm signal for beam tracking channel. HI780 fiber was selected for common output port of the device to maintain the orthogonality of polarization states and beam quality of the quantum channel. Although 1550 nm signal can suffer from the insertion and bending loss caused by smaller core size of the HI780 fiber, we could reduce the loss as low as 1.4 dB by designing the fiber with length within about 15 cm, well straightened. We could also obtain good beam quality and mode overlap of the quantum and beam tracking channels by using the common output port of the WDM filter.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster126Kim.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Minchul Kim

A narrow detector cross-section, such as with fibre coupling to a telescope, reduces the field of view (FOV) and thus increases the loss due to atmospheric turbulence. A larger detector cross-section increases the FOV; however, the corresponding increase in background noise also increases the QBER associated with a Discrete Variable (DV) QKD system. On the contrary, Continuous Variable (CV) QKD systems are highly tolerant to background noise, but their performance is still limited by the channel loss. The FOV of the receiver is defined as the area expressed in solid angle from which the detector can accepts signal. A simple geometrical analysis reveals FOV as $\Theta = 2\tan^{-1}(d/2F)$, where $d$ is the detector diameter and $F$ is the effective focal length of the receiver telescope. With a large-area detector, one can design the signal collection optics, such that the FOV of the telescope with a given aperture can be larger. In this work, we present a larger FOV receiver system for CVQKD which reduces the channel loss due to beam wandering and atmospheric turbulence. We will describe the performance of the receiver system in terms of shot-noise sensitivity, loss reduction and enhancement in secure key rate, compared to a typical fibre-coupled receiver system.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster127Konieczniak.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Igor Konieczniak

After the proposal of the original protocol, multiple papers have extended the protocol to prove its security. However, these works are limited to the case where the two channels have equal amount of loss (i.e. are symmetric). In a practical network setting, it is very likely that the channels are asymmetric due to e.g. geographical locations. In this work we extend a version of the TF-QKD protocol to the scenario with asymmetric channels. We show that by simply adjusting the two signal states of the two users (and not necessarily the decoy states) they can effectively compensate for channel asymmetry and consistently obtain higher key rate than either using no compensation or using the strategy of deliberately adding fibre to the shorter channel. We perform simulation with realistic parameters and finite data size, and show that our method works well and has a clear advantage over prior art methods in the presence of channel asymmetry.</div></div><div class=paper-youtubeid></div><div class=poster-pdf><a href="posters/QCrypt2020Poster140Wang.pdf" target=_blank>[PDF]</a></div><div class=poster-presenter>Poster presented by: Wenyuan Wang

Continuous variable (CV) QKD that uses the coherent states and homodyne detection can only apply the cost-effective telecommunication components[1]. The field test of CV-QKD has reached over 50 km[2], and under the laboratory conditions, experimental demonstration of over 200km has been reported [3], thus, has revealed great potentials in practical implementations. The access network that allows multitude end-users to connect to the nodal network is a necessary in the modern network infrastructure since it is suitable for general home-to-home scenarios. Quantum access network was first proposed [4] and demonstrated in field tests [5] for discrete variable QKD. Here, we report an upstream access network based on CV-QKD. In our experimental demonstrations, two transmitters Alice are deployed as optical network units that simultaneously send signals to the network, the receiver Bob is acted as the optical line terminal. The optical distribution network is located between the optical network units and the optical line terminal to couple the signals. The signals generated from each optical network unit are required to pass through a variable delay line to calibrate the arriving time at the optical distribution network before being transmitted. The signals are then simultaneously sent to the optical distribution network through fibers of 5.3 km and 12.3 km respectively. When the signals approach to the optical distribution network, dynamic polarization control modules are firstly applied in each path to pre-compensate the polarization. The signals are then coupled through a beamsplitter and forwarded to the optical line terminal. With a system repetition frequency of 2.5 MHz, we obtain the averaged secret key rates of 55 kbps and 22 kbps for Alice No. 1 and Alice No. 2 respectively. The total secret key rates has reached 77 kbps which suggests a higher network capacity. The excess noise is relatively stable, yet there are small fluctuations in the secret key rates. To one step further reduce the loss, the wavelength division multiplexing devices can be used at the optical distribution network. This is especially beneficial when the quantum signal has to co-propagate with classical data channels in the same fiber [6,7]. The upstream access network implementations can be easily extended to a higher repetition frequency system or to support more users. The demonstration experiments provide the possibility of building practical large-scale CV-QKD networks.
